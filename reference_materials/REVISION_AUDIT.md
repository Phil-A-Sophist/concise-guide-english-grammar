# Revision Audit: Concise Guide to English Grammar

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the current textbook against originality and pedagogical requirements for an open educational resource. The textbook has **21 chapters** in PreTeXt XML format, organized in 6 thematic sections.

**Note:** This audit was originally written against a 27-chapter structure and has been updated (2026-02-13) to reflect the current 21-chapter organization. Consolidation from 27 to 21 chapters merged and reorganized significant content. Assessments from the original audit have been carried forward where applicable, but chapters that were heavily consolidated may need fresh review.

## Revision Priority Summary

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. Chapter 8: Sentence Elements and Patterns — Example originality concern, needs image diagrams
2. Chapter 9: Compound and Complex Sentences — Conjunction examples may mirror handouts, needs diagrams

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Review and Refresh)
3. Chapters 4-7: Review examples for originality, integrate diagrams
4. Chapters 10-11: Verify consolidation adequately covers tense/aspect/voice/modals (were underdeveloped as separate chapters)
5. Chapters 12-15: Review form/function chapters, especially 13-14 which may incorporate former skeleton chapters
6. Chapters 16-21: Review Writing/Style/Applied chapters (several correspond to former skeleton chapters)

### LOW PRIORITY (Minor Touch-ups)
7. Chapters 1-3: Well-developed foundational chapters

---

## Specific Changes Required

### Examples to Verify Against Source Materials
- Chapter 8: "Cameras flashed," "I am an optimist," "Weasels stalk rabbits," "Marie sent Ramon a gift"
- Review example sentences in Chapters 5-9

### Diagrams to Integrate
- Chapter 7: Introductory diagramming examples
- Chapter 8: All six sentence pattern diagrams
- Chapter 9: Compound and complex sentence diagrams
- Chapter 11: Auxiliary verb structure diagrams
- Chapter 14: Relative clause diagrams

### Structural Additions Needed
- Common misconceptions sections
- More embedded comprehension checks
- Progressive difficulty in examples
- Summary/review sections (some chapters missing)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Continue language example formatting rollout** (Chapters 4-5, then 7-21)
2. **Fresh review of consolidated chapters** — Chapters that merged multiple old chapters (5-6, 8-11, 13-14, 16) need assessment of whether consolidation produced adequate coverage
3. **Fresh review of new/expanded chapters** — Chapters with no old equivalent (15, 20, 21) need quality assessment
4. **Integrate diagrams** using PreTeXt figure syntax
5. **Consistency pass** for terminology and cross-references
6. **Create answer keys** for Chapters 16-21
