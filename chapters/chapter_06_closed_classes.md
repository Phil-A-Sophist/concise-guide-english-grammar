## 6.1 Open vs. Closed Classes

Chapter 5 introduced **open classes**—word categories that freely accept new members (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). This chapter examines **closed classes**—word categories with a fixed membership that rarely changes.

### Closed Classes Defined

**Closed classes** resist new members. They contain a fixed (or nearly fixed) inventory of words that has remained stable for centuries:

- **Determiners**: *the*, *a*, *this*, *my*, *every*, *some*...
- **Pronouns**: *I*, *you*, *he*, *she*, *it*, *we*, *they*...
- **Prepositions**: *in*, *on*, *at*, *to*, *from*, *with*...
- **Conjunctions**: *and*, *but*, *or*, *if*, *because*, *although*...
- **Auxiliary verbs**: *be*, *have*, *do*, *can*, *will*, *might*...

When did English last add a new preposition? A new pronoun? These classes have been essentially stable for centuries. Even the gradual acceptance of singular *they* represents an expansion of function, not a new word.

### Why the Difference Matters

Closed-class words differ from open-class words in important ways:

**Function vs. content**: Open-class words carry most of the *content* meaning—ideas, actions, qualities. Closed-class words carry *grammatical* meaning—they show relationships, specify reference, and connect elements.

| Open-class (content-rich) | Closed-class (grammatical) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| *student*, *discovered*, *ancient* | *the*, *in*, *she*, *and*, *have* |

**Memorization vs. productivity**: Because closed classes are small, speakers memorize every member. Open classes are too large for complete memorization.

**Processing**: Psycholinguistic research suggests that closed-class words are processed differently—retrieved as whole units rather than assembled from parts.

This chapter focuses on three closed classes essential for understanding sentence structure: determiners, pronouns, and prepositions.

## 6.2 Determiners

**Determiners** introduce noun phrases and help specify reference—they help listeners identify which entity or entities the speaker means.

### What Determiners Do

When you hear "I saw **a** dog," the determiner *a* signals that the dog is being introduced for the first time (indefinite reference). When you hear "I saw **the** dog," *the* signals that you should already know which dog (definite reference).

Determiners answer questions like:
- Which one? (*the*, *this*, *that*)
- How many? (*three*, *several*, *many*)
- Whose? (*my*, *the professor's*)
- Which subset? (*some*, *any*, *every*, *no*)

### Types of Determiners

**Articles**—the most common determiners:
- **Definite article** (*the*): The referent is identifiable to the listener
- **Indefinite articles** (*a*, *an*): The referent is being introduced or is unspecified

**Demonstratives**—point to specific entities:
- **Near**: *this*, *these* (close to speaker)
- **Far**: *that*, *those* (farther from speaker)

**Possessives**—indicate ownership or relationship:
- **Pronoun forms**: *my*, *your*, *his*, *her*, *its*, *our*, *their*
- **Noun + 's**: *John's*, *the dog's*, *my sister's*

**Quantifiers**—indicate amount or quantity:
- **Universal**: *all*, *every*, *each*, *both*
- **Existential**: *some*, *any*, *no*
- **Degree**: *many*, *much*, *few*, *little*, *several*, *enough*

**Numbers**:
- **Cardinal**: *one*, *two*, *three*...
- **Ordinal**: *first*, *second*, *third*...

**Interrogative/Relative**: *which*, *what*, *whose*

### Determiner Position

Determiners occupy a specific position in the noun phrase—they come first, before any adjectives:

```
Det + (Adj) + N

the     big    dog
my      old    friend
some    fresh  bread
```

**Important**: Most determiners are mutually exclusive—you cannot stack them:
- *~~the my book~~*
- *~~this the student~~*
- *~~a every dog~~*

However, some combinations are allowed:
- *all the students* (predeterminer + article)
- *both my parents* (predeterminer + possessive)
- *the first three chapters* (article + ordinal + cardinal)

### Determiners vs. Adjectives

Determiners and adjectives both appear before nouns, but they differ systematically:

| Feature | Determiners | Adjectives |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Class membership | Closed | Open |
| Position | First (before adjectives) | After determiners |
| Function | Specify reference | Describe qualities |
| Stacking | Limited combinations | Multiple allowed |
| Obligatoriness | Often required | Always optional |
| Gradable | Usually not (*~~very the~~*) | Usually yes (*very tall*) |

Compare:
- *The* is required for singular count nouns in many contexts: *~~Book is on table.~~*
- *Interesting* is always optional: *The book is on the table.*

### Count vs. Mass Nouns and Determiners

Determiner choice interacts with whether a noun is count (discrete entities) or mass (undifferentiated substance):

| Determiner | Count Singular | Count Plural | Mass |
|------------|----------------|--------------|------|
| *a/an* | ✓ *a book* | ✗ | ✗ |
| *the* | ✓ *the book* | ✓ *the books* | ✓ *the water* |
| *this/that* | ✓ *this book* | ✗ | ✓ *this water* |
| *these/those* | ✗ | ✓ *these books* | ✗ |
| *some* | ✗ | ✓ *some books* | ✓ *some water* |
| *many* | ✗ | ✓ *many books* | ✗ |
| *much* | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ *much water* |

These patterns are systematic—native speakers follow them automatically.

---

## 6.3 Pronouns

**Pronouns** replace noun phrases. They allow speakers to refer to entities without repeating full NPs—crucial for efficient communication.

### Why Pronouns Exist

Imagine language without pronouns:

*Maria said that Maria wanted Maria's book back, but John told Maria that John had already returned Maria's book to Maria's office.*

Now with pronouns:

*Maria said that she wanted her book back, but John told her that he had already returned it to her office.*

Pronouns reduce redundancy and improve processing. But they require listeners to track what each pronoun refers to—its **antecedent**.

### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are the most common type. They vary for:

- **Person**: 1st (speaker), 2nd (addressee), 3rd (other)
- **Number**: singular vs. plural
- **Case**: subject vs. object vs. possessive
- **Gender** (3rd person singular): masculine, feminine, neuter

| Person | Subject | Object | Possessive Det | Possessive Pro |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| 1st sg | I | me | my | mine |
| 2nd sg | you | you | your | yours |
| 3rd sg masc | he | him | his | his |
| 3rd sg fem | she | her | her | hers |
| 3rd sg neut | it | it | its | — |
| 1st pl | we | us | our | ours |
| 2nd pl | you | you | your | yours |
| 3rd pl | they | them | their | theirs |

**Case matters**: Use subject forms for subjects, object forms for objects:
- Subject: ***She** left.* (not *~~Her left.~~*)
- Object: *I saw **her**.* (not *~~I saw she.~~*)
- After preposition: *with **me*** (not *~~with I~~*)

**Singular "they"**: Increasingly accepted for indefinite reference and for people who don't identify as he or she:
- *Someone left **their** book.* (indefinite)
- *Alex said **they** would come.* (nonbinary reference)

### Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns end in *-self* (singular) or *-selves* (plural):

*myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves*

They are used when the object refers to the same entity as the subject:
- *She hurt **herself**.* (she = herself)
- *They saw **themselves** in the mirror.*

Reflexives cannot be subjects and require an antecedent in the same clause:
- *~~**Himself** arrived.~~*
- *~~I saw **herself**.~~* (no matching antecedent)

### Demonstrative Pronouns

*This*, *that*, *these*, *those* can function as pronouns (standing alone) or determiners (with a noun):

- **Pronoun**: ***This** is interesting.* ***Those** are mine.*
- **Determiner**: ***This book** is interesting.* ***Those books** are mine.*

As pronouns, demonstratives typically refer to things just mentioned, about to be mentioned, or physically present.

### Interrogative Pronouns

Question words that stand for unknown NPs:

- *Who/whom* (people): ***Who** called?* *I saw **whom**?*
- *What* (things): ***What** happened?*
- *Which* (selective): ***Which** do you want?*
- *Whose* (possession): ***Whose** is this?*

**Who vs. whom**: Traditional grammar requires *whom* as object (*Whom did you see?*), but modern English often uses *who* in all positions except after prepositions (*To whom* remains preferred over *To who*).

### Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses:

- *who/whom/whose* (people): *the man **who** arrived*
- *which* (things): *the book **which** I read*
- *that* (people or things): *the person **that** called*

The relative pronoun connects the clause to its antecedent and plays a grammatical role within the clause:

*The student **who** won the prize...* (*who* = subject of *won*)
*The book **that** I read...* (*that* = object of *read*)

### Indefinite Pronouns

Pronouns that refer to unspecified entities:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Universal** | *everyone*, *everybody*, *everything*, *all*, *each*, *both* |
| **Existential** | *someone*, *somebody*, *something*, *some*, *any* |
| **Negative** | *no one*, *nobody*, *nothing*, *none* |

Many indefinites are grammatically singular even when semantically plural:
- *Everyone **is** here.* (not *~~Everyone are~~*)
- *Each of the students **has** arrived.*

---

## 6.4 Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases

**Prepositions** are closed-class words that show relationships—typically spatial, temporal, or logical—between elements in a sentence. They combine with noun phrases to form **prepositional phrases (PPs)**.

### Identifying Prepositions

A traditional mnemonic says prepositions describe "anywhere a cat can be": *in* the box, *on* the table, *under* the chair, *beside* the sofa, *near* the window, *through* the door...

But prepositions express much more than spatial relationships:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Spatial** | *in*, *on*, *at*, *above*, *below*, *under*, *over*, *between*, *among*, *through*, *across*, *behind*, *beside*, *near*, *toward* |
| **Temporal** | *before*, *after*, *during*, *since*, *until*, *throughout* |
| **Logical/Abstract** | *of*, *for*, *with*, *by*, *about*, *without*, *despite*, *concerning*, *regarding* |

**Complex prepositions** are multi-word units that function as single prepositions:
- *because of*, *instead of*, *in spite of*
- *according to*, *due to*, *prior to*
- *in front of*, *on top of*, *in addition to*

### Prepositional Phrase Structure

A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition plus its **object** (typically a noun phrase):

```
PP → Prep + NP

in     the morning
on     the tall wooden table
to     my best friend
from   the old house on the corner
about  the recent controversy
```

The object of the preposition can be:
- A simple noun: *in **town***
- A complex NP: *in **the busy downtown area***
- A pronoun: *with **her*** (object form required)
- A gerund: *after **leaving***, *without **knowing***

### PP Functions: Adjectival vs. Adverbial

Prepositional phrases function as **modifiers**—either **adjectival** (modifying nouns) or **adverbial** (modifying verbs, adjectives, or sentences). Understanding this distinction is essential for accurate sentence analysis.

#### Adjectival PPs

**Adjectival PPs** modify nouns, answering "which one?" or "what kind?":

- *the man **in the hat*** (which man?)
- *a book **about grammar*** (what kind of book?)
- *the house **on the corner*** (which house?)
- *a sense **of accomplishment*** (what kind of sense?)

Adjectival PPs follow the noun they modify and remain part of the noun phrase:

```
NP
├── Det: the
├── N: man
└── PP: in the hat (adjectival—modifies "man")
```

**Key characteristic**: Adjectival PPs are embedded within the NP. When you replace the NP with a pronoun, the PP disappears:
- *The man in the hat waved.* → ***He** waved.*

#### Adverbial PPs

**Adverbial PPs** modify verbs (or whole sentences), providing information about time, place, manner, reason, etc.:

- *She arrived **at noon**.* (when?)
- *He works **in the office**.* (where?)
- *They spoke **with enthusiasm**.* (how?)
- *We left **because of the weather**.* (why?)
- ***In the morning**, we will leave.* (when?)

Adverbial PPs attach to the verb phrase, not to any particular noun:

```
S
├── NP: She
└── VP
    ├── V: waited
    └── PP: in the lobby (adverbial—modifies "waited")
```

**Key characteristic**: Adverbial PPs can often move to different positions in the sentence:
- *She waited **in the lobby**.*
- ***In the lobby**, she waited.*

### Distinguishing Adjectival from Adverbial PPs

The key question: **What does the PP modify?**

**Test 1: What question does it answer?**
- "Which man?" → adjectival (*the man in the hat*)
- "Where/when/how?" → adverbial (*waited in the hall*)

**Test 2: Can it move to sentence-initial position?**
- Adverbial PPs often can: ***In the morning**, we left.*
- Adjectival PPs typically cannot: *~~**In the hat**, the man waved.~~*

**Test 3: Does the noun phrase make sense without it?**
- If removing the PP leaves a sensible (if less specific) NP, it's adjectival: *The man waved.* (works—which man is less clear)
- If the PP provides information about the action itself, it's adverbial

### Ambiguous PP Attachment

Some sentences are ambiguous because the PP could attach to either the NP or the VP:

*She saw the man with binoculars.*

- **Adjectival reading**: "the man who had binoculars" (PP modifies *man*)
- **Adverbial reading**: "she used binoculars to see him" (PP modifies *saw*)

*He discussed the problem with the professor.*

- **Adjectival reading**: "the problem that involves the professor"
- **Adverbial reading**: "he discussed it alongside the professor"

In speech, context usually resolves such ambiguity. In writing, you may need to restructure for clarity:
- *She saw the man who had binoculars.* (adjectival)
- *Using binoculars, she saw the man.* (adverbial)

### Multiple PPs in a Sentence

Sentences often contain multiple prepositional phrases with different functions:

*The student **from Colorado** studied **in the library** **for three hours**.*

- ***from Colorado***: adjectival (modifies *student*—which student?)
- ***in the library***: adverbial (modifies *studied*—where?)
- ***for three hours***: adverbial (modifies *studied*—how long?)

### Prepositions vs. Other Categories

**Preposition or particle?**

Some words that look like prepositions are actually **particles**—part of phrasal verbs:

- *She looked **up** the word.* (particle—part of *look up*)
- *She looked **up** the chimney.* (preposition—*up the chimney* is a PP)

**Test**: Can you move it after the object?
- *She looked the word **up**.* ✓ (particle)
- *~~She looked the chimney **up**.~~* ✗ (preposition)

**Preposition or subordinating conjunction?**

Some words can be either:
- *I left **before** noon.* (*before* = preposition; *noon* = NP object)
- *I left **before** she arrived.* (*before* = conjunction; introduces clause)

## 6.5 Comparing the Three Classes

These three closed classes share important properties but differ in function:

### Shared Properties

| Property | Determiners | Pronouns | Prepositions |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Closed class | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Limited membership | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Grammatical function | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| High frequency | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### Distinctive Functions

| Class | Primary Function |
|-------|------------------|
| **Determiners** | Specify reference within NPs |
| **Pronouns** | Replace entire NPs |
| **Prepositions** | Show relationships; head PPs |

### How They Work Together

In a sentence like *She gave the book to him*, all three classes appear:
- *She* (pronoun)—replaces a full NP as subject
- *the* (determiner)—specifies which book
- *to* (preposition)—shows relationship (recipient)
- *him* (pronoun)—replaces a full NP as object of preposition

Each closed-class word does minimal semantic work but essential grammatical work—they're the glue that holds sentences together.

## Chapter Summary

- **Closed classes** have fixed membership and serve primarily grammatical functions.
- **Determiners** introduce noun phrases and specify reference (which, whose, how many).
- **Pronouns** replace noun phrases, reducing redundancy and enabling efficient reference.
- **Prepositions** head prepositional phrases that function as adjectival or adverbial modifiers.
- **Adjectival PPs** modify nouns, answering "which one?" or "what kind?"
- **Adverbial PPs** modify verbs/sentences, answering "when?" "where?" "how?" "why?"
- PP attachment can be ambiguous; context and careful analysis resolve the ambiguity.
- These three closed classes work together to provide the grammatical structure of sentences.
