## 14.1 Nouns vs. Nominals: Form vs. Function

Understanding the distinction between **nouns** (a form/part of speech) and **nominals** (a function) is essential for accurate grammatical analysis.

### Noun as Form

A **noun** is a part of speech—a word class with particular morphological and syntactic characteristics (Chapter 5). Nouns can be pluralized, possess, follow determiners, and serve as subjects/objects.

- *book*, *happiness*, *Maria*, *government*

### Nominal as Function

A **nominal** is any word, phrase, or clause that **functions** in a position typically occupied by a noun phrase—as subject, object, or complement.

**Key insight**: All nouns functioning as subjects/objects are nominals, but not all nominals are nouns.

---

## 14.2 Structures That Function as Nominals

Many different structures can serve the nominal function.

### 1. Noun Phrases

The prototypical nominal is a noun phrase:

- ***The book** is on the table.* (subject)
- *I read **the interesting book**.* (object)
- *This is **my sister**.* (subject complement)

### 2. Pronouns

Pronouns replace entire noun phrases:

- ***She** arrived early.* (subject)
- *I saw **them**.* (object)
- *The winner is **he**.* (complement, formal)

### 3. Noun Clauses (That-clauses)

Clauses introduced by *that* function as nominals:

- ***That she resigned** surprised everyone.* (subject)
- *I believe **that she is honest**.* (object)
- *The problem is **that we're out of time**.* (complement)

### 4. Noun Clauses (Wh-clauses)

Clauses introduced by wh-words function as nominals:

- ***What she said** was important.* (subject)
- *I don't know **where he went**.* (object)
- *The question is **who will lead**.* (complement)

### 5. Gerund Phrases

*-ing* forms of verbs (gerunds) head phrases that function as nominals:

- ***Swimming** is good exercise.* (subject)
- *She enjoys **reading novels**.* (object)
- *His hobby is **collecting stamps**.* (complement)

### 6. Infinitive Phrases (Nominal)

Infinitive phrases (*to* + verb) can function as nominals:

- ***To err** is human.* (subject)
- *She wants **to succeed**.* (object)
- *The goal is **to finish on time**.* (complement)

### 7. Nominalized Adjectives

Some adjectives, with a determiner, function nominally (referring to a group):

- ***The poor** need assistance.*
- ***The rich** have advantages.*
- ***The accused** denied the charges.*

---

## 14.3 Noun Clauses in Detail

**Noun clauses** are dependent clauses that function as nominals—as subjects, objects, or complements.

### That-clauses

Introduced by *that* (which may be omitted in some positions):

**As subject**:
- ***That she won** surprised no one.*
- ***That the earth is round** is well established.*

**As object** (*that* often omitted):
- *I believe **(that)** she's honest.*
- *He knows **(that)** we're coming.*

**As complement**:
- *The truth is **that we need more time**.*
- *My hope is **that things will improve**.*

**After adjectives**:
- *I'm glad **that you came**.*
- *She was certain **that he was wrong**.*

### Wh-clauses (Interrogative Content Clauses)

Introduced by wh-words (*what*, *who*, *which*, *where*, *when*, *why*, *how*, *whether*, *if*):

**As subject**:
- ***What she discovered** changed everything.*
- ***Where they went** remains a mystery.*
- ***Whether he'll accept** is uncertain.*

**As object**:
- *I don't know **what happened**.*
- *She asked **whether I was coming**.*
- *Tell me **how you did it**.*

**As complement**:
- *The issue is **how we proceed**.*
- *The question is **whether to accept**.*

### If vs. Whether

Both introduce yes/no noun clauses, but:

- **Whether** can be a subject; **if** typically cannot:
  - ***Whether** he comes remains to be seen.* ✓
  - *~~**If** he comes remains to be seen.~~* ✗ (awkward)

- **Whether** allows *or not* immediately after; **if** does not:
  - *I don't know **whether or not** she's coming.* ✓
  - *~~I don't know **if or not** she's coming.~~* ✗

## 14.4 Gerund Phrases as Nominals

A **gerund** is the *-ing* form of a verb functioning nominally. A **gerund phrase** includes the gerund and its complements/modifiers.

### Gerund Structure

```
Gerund Phrase = (Possessive) + Gerund + (Complements/Modifiers)
```

- ***Swimming** is fun.* (simple gerund)
- ***Swimming laps** is good exercise.* (gerund + object)
- ***His swimming** improved.* (possessive + gerund)
- ***Their constantly complaining** annoys everyone.* (possessive + modifier + gerund)

### Gerund Functions

**As subject**:
- ***Running marathons** requires dedication.*
- ***Finishing on time** seemed impossible.*

**As object**:
- *She enjoys **cooking elaborate meals**.*
- *He avoided **making promises**.*

**As object of preposition**:
- *She succeeded by **working hard**.*
- *He's interested in **learning languages**.*

**As complement**:
- *His favorite activity is **reading**.*
- *The challenge was **convincing the board**.*

### Possessive with Gerunds

Formal usage prefers possessive forms before gerunds:
- *I appreciated **his helping** us.* (formal)
- *I appreciated **him helping** us.* (informal)

Both are acceptable in modern English, though the possessive is preferred in formal writing.

---

## 14.5 Infinitive Phrases as Nominals

Infinitive phrases (*to* + base verb) can function nominally in certain positions.

### Infinitive Structure

```
Infinitive Phrase = to + Verb + (Complements/Modifiers)
```

- ***To swim** is fun.* (simple infinitive)
- ***To finish on time** seemed impossible.* (infinitive + modifier)
- ***To convince the board of our plan** took hours.* (infinitive + complex complement)

### Infinitive Functions

**As subject** (often with extraposition):
- ***To err** is human.*
- *It is difficult **to learn a new language**.* (extraposed)

**As object**:
- *She wants **to succeed**.*
- *They decided **to leave early**.*
- *He hopes **to be promoted**.*

**As complement**:
- *The goal is **to finish on time**.*
- *Her dream is **to travel the world**.*

### Extraposition

When infinitive subjects are long, English often "extraposits" them, using *it* as a placeholder subject:

- ***To explain all the details** would take too long.* (full subject)
- ***It** would take too long **to explain all the details**.* (extraposed)

---

## 14.6 Comparing Nominal Structures

Different nominal structures may seem interchangeable but often carry subtle differences in meaning or style.

### Gerund vs. Infinitive

Many verbs take either gerund or infinitive objects with little difference:
- *I like **swimming**.* / *I like **to swim**.*
- *She started **working**.* / *She started **to work**.*

But some verbs show clear differences:

**Gerund only**: *enjoy*, *avoid*, *finish*, *deny*, *consider*
- *She enjoys **swimming**.* (not *~~to swim~~*)

**Infinitive only**: *want*, *hope*, *decide*, *agree*, *refuse*
- *She wants **to swim**.* (not *~~swimming~~*)

**Different meanings**:
- *I stopped **smoking**.* (quit the habit)
- *I stopped **to smoke**.* (paused in order to smoke)

- *I remember **locking** the door.* (I recall doing it)
- *I remember **to lock** the door.* (I don't forget to do it)

### That-clause vs. Infinitive

Some verbs allow both:
- *I believe **that she's honest**.*
- *I believe **her to be honest**.*

The infinitive construction may sound more formal.

### That-clause vs. Gerund

Some verbs take either:
- *He admitted **that he was wrong**.*
- *He admitted **being wrong**.*

The gerund is often more concise.

## 14.7 Nominal Positions in Sentences

Nominals occupy specific syntactic positions.

### Subject Position

Before the main verb:
- ***The students** studied.*
- ***That he won** surprised us.*
- ***Swimming** is fun.*

### Direct Object Position

After a transitive verb:
- *She read **the book**.*
- *I know **that she's coming**.*
- *He enjoys **playing chess**.*

### Indirect Object Position

Before the direct object:
- *She gave **me** a book.*
- *Tell **whoever asks** the truth.*

### Object of Preposition

After a preposition:
- *We talked about **the problem**.*
- *I'm interested in **what you said**.*
- *She succeeded by **working hard**.*

### Subject Complement Position

After a linking verb:
- *She is **a doctor**.*
- *The problem is **that we're late**.*
- *His hobby is **collecting coins**.*

- **Gerund phrases** (*-ing* forms) function nominally in all positions.
- **Infinitive phrases** function nominally primarily as subjects (often extraposed) and objects.
- Different nominal structures may carry different meanings or stylistic effects.
