## 15.1 The Purpose of Punctuation

Punctuation marks are visual signals that clarify meaning and guide readers through text. They indicate pauses, separate elements, and show relationships between parts of sentences.

Good punctuation makes prose easier to read and prevents misunderstanding:

- *Let's eat grandma.* (disturbing)
- *Let's eat, grandma.* (dinner invitation)

---

## 15.2 Terminal Punctuation

### Period (.)

Ends declarative sentences and mild imperatives:
- *The meeting is at noon.*
- *Please close the door.*

### Question Mark (?)

Ends direct questions:
- *What time is it?*
- *Have you finished?*

**Note**: Indirect questions take periods:
- *She asked what time it was.*

### Exclamation Point (!)

Indicates strong emotion or emphasis:
- *Watch out!*
- *What a surprise!*

Use sparingly in formal writing.

---

## 15.3 The Comma

The comma is the most frequently used—and misused—punctuation mark.

### Comma in Compound Sentences

Place a comma before a coordinating conjunction joining independent clauses:

- *The sun set, **and** the stars appeared.*
- *She tried hard, **but** she didn't succeed.*

### Comma After Introductory Elements

Use a comma after introductory phrases or clauses:

- ***After the meeting,** we went to lunch.*
- ***However,** I disagree.*
- ***Running quickly,** she caught the bus.*

### Commas with Nonrestrictive Elements

Set off nonrestrictive (non-essential) modifiers with commas:

- *My sister, **who lives in Boston**, is visiting.*
- *The report, **which I submitted yesterday**, was approved.*

**Do not** use commas with restrictive (essential) modifiers:
- *The students who studied passed.* (no commas—specifies which students)

### Commas in Series

Separate items in a list:
- *She bought apples, oranges, and bananas.*

The comma before *and* (the Oxford comma) is optional but recommended for clarity:
- *I admire my parents, Gandhi, and Mother Teresa.* (clear)
- *I admire my parents, Gandhi and Mother Teresa.* (ambiguous)

### Commas with Coordinate Adjectives

Separate adjectives that independently modify the noun:
- *a tall, elegant woman* (tall and elegant both modify *woman*)

**Test**: If you can put *and* between them, use a comma.

**Don't** use commas between cumulative adjectives:
- *a big red barn* (not *~~big, red barn~~*—*big red* modifies *barn* together)

### Comma Misuse

**Comma splice**: Using only a comma between independent clauses:
- *~~The rain stopped, we went outside.~~*
- Correct: *The rain stopped, and we went outside.*

**Separating subject from verb**:
- *~~The man who arrived late, was my cousin.~~*
- Correct: *The man who arrived late was my cousin.*

---

## 15.4 The Semicolon

### Between Independent Clauses

Joins related independent clauses without a conjunction:
- *The rain stopped; we went outside.*
- *She's talented; however, she lacks experience.*

### In Complex Series

Separates items in a series when items contain commas:
- *The committee includes Dr. Smith, president; Mr. Jones, treasurer; and Ms. Lee, secretary.*

---

## 15.5 The Colon

### Introducing Lists

Use a colon after a complete sentence to introduce a list:
- *Please bring the following items: a pen, a notebook, and a calculator.*

**Don't** use a colon after an incomplete sentence:
- *~~Please bring: a pen, a notebook, and a calculator.~~*
- Correct: *Please bring a pen, a notebook, and a calculator.*

### Introducing Explanations

Use a colon to introduce an explanation or elaboration:
- *She had one goal: to finish her degree.*
- *The answer was clear: we needed more data.*

### In Formal Contexts

Between titles and subtitles:
- *Grammar Matters: A Guide to Standard English*

After salutations in formal letters:
- *Dear Dr. Smith:*

---

## 15.6 The Apostrophe

### Possession

**Singular nouns**: Add *'s*
- *the dog's tail*
- *James's book* (or *James' book*)

**Plural nouns ending in *-s***: Add *'*
- *the dogs' tails*
- *the students' grades*

**Plural nouns not ending in *-s***: Add *'s*
- *the children's toys*
- *the women's team*

### Contractions

Apostrophes replace omitted letters:
- *don't* (do not)
- *it's* (it is)
- *they're* (they are)

### Common Errors

**Its vs. It's**:
- *Its* = possessive (*The dog wagged its tail.*)
- *It's* = it is (*It's raining.*)

**Their, There, They're**:
- *Their* = possessive (*Their house*)
- *There* = location (*over there*)
- *They're* = they are (*They're coming*)

---

## 15.7 Dashes and Parentheses

### Em Dash (—)

Sets off emphatic or interrupting material:
- *The answer—surprisingly—was yes.*
- *She had one goal—and only one—to succeed.*

Creates stronger emphasis than commas.

### En Dash (–)

Indicates ranges:
- *pages 10–20*
- *the 2020–2021 academic year*

### Parentheses ( )

Enclose supplementary or explanatory material:
- *The results (see Table 3) were significant.*
- *She graduated in 2010 (the same year I started).*

Creates less emphasis than dashes.

---

## 15.8 Quotation Marks

### Direct Quotations

Enclose exact words:
- *She said, "I'll be there."*
- *"I'll be there," she said.*

### Titles

Use for shorter works (articles, chapters, poems, songs):
- *I read "The Road Not Taken."*

### Punctuation with Quotation Marks

**American convention**: Periods and commas inside quotation marks:
- *She said, "I agree."*
- *He called it "amazing," but I disagreed.*

**British convention**: Periods and commas may go outside if not part of the quotation.

Question marks and exclamation points depend on the quotation:
- *Did she say "yes"?* (question is mine)
- *She asked, "Are you coming?"* (question is hers)
