## 10.1 Auxiliary Verbs

**Auxiliary verbs** (also called helping verbs) combine with main verbs to create complex verb phrases. They add grammatical information about tense, aspect, voice, and modality.

### Auxiliary vs. Main Verb

**Main verb** (lexical verb): Carries the primary meaning
**Auxiliary verb**: Adds grammatical information

*She **has eaten** dinner.*
- Auxiliary: *has* (adds perfect aspect)
- Main verb: *eaten* (the action)

*The book **was written** by Maria.*
- Auxiliary: *was* (adds passive voice)
- Main verb: *written* (the action)

### Types of Auxiliaries

**Primary auxiliaries**: *be*, *have*, *do*
- Form progressive, perfect, and passive constructions
- Can also be main verbs

**Modal auxiliaries**: *can*, *could*, *will*, *would*, *shall*, *should*, *may*, *might*, *must*
- Add modality (possibility, necessity, permission, etc.)
- Covered in Chapter 11

---

## 10.2 Primary Auxiliary: *Be*

*Be* is the most versatile auxiliary, used for both progressive aspect and passive voice.

### Forms of *Be*

| Present | Past | Participles |
|---------|------|-------------|
| am, is, are | was, were | been, being |

### Functions of Auxiliary *Be*

**Progressive aspect** (be + -ing):
- *She **is reading**.* (present progressive)
- *They **were studying**.* (past progressive)
- *He **has been working**.* (present perfect progressive)

**Passive voice** (be + past participle):
- *The book **was written** by Maria.*
- *The house **is being built**.*
- *The work **will be completed**.*

### *Be* as Main Verb vs. Auxiliary

*Be* can also be a main verb (copular/linking):
- *She **is** a teacher.* (main verb—links subject to complement)

**Distinguishing**:
- Followed by *-ing* form = auxiliary: *She **is reading**.*
- Followed by past participle = auxiliary (passive): *It **was done**.*
- Followed by NP, AdjP, PP = main verb: *She **is** happy.*

---

## 10.3 Primary Auxiliary: *Have*

*Have* forms the perfect aspect, indicating that an action is completed or has continuing relevance.

### Forms of *Have*

| Present | Past | Participle |
|---------|------|------------|
| have, has | had | had |

### Functions of Auxiliary *Have*

**Perfect aspect** (have + past participle):
- *She **has finished** the work.* (present perfect)
- *They **had left** before I arrived.* (past perfect)
- *By then, I **will have completed** it.* (future perfect)

### *Have* as Main Verb vs. Auxiliary

*Have* is also a main verb meaning "possess":
- *I **have** a car.* (main verb)
- *I **have seen** that movie.* (auxiliary)

**Test**: Can you add *got* after *have*?
- *I have (got) a car.* ✓ (main verb)
- *~~I have got seen that movie.~~* ✗ (auxiliary)

---

## 10.4 Primary Auxiliary: *Do*

*Do* is used for emphasis, questions, and negation when no other auxiliary is present.

### Forms of *Do*

| Present | Past |
|---------|------|
| do, does | did |

### Functions of Auxiliary *Do*

**Do-support**: When a sentence needs an auxiliary (for questions, negation) but has none, *do* is inserted:

**Questions**:
- *She **works** here.* → ***Does** she work here?*
- *They **left** early.* → ***Did** they leave early?*

**Negation**:
- *She **works** here.* → *She **doesn't** work here.*
- *They **left** early.* → *They **didn't** leave early.*

**Emphasis**:
- *I **do** understand your concern.*
- *She **did** finish the assignment.*

**Note**: If another auxiliary is present, *do* is not used:
- *She **is** working.* → ***Is** she working?* (not *~~Does she is working?~~*)
- *He **has** left.* → ***Has** he left?*

---

## 10.5 Tense: Locating Events in Time

**Tense** is a grammatical category that locates situations in time, typically marked by verb inflection.

### Tense vs. Time

**Tense** is grammatical—a form of the verb.
**Time** is conceptual—when something actually happens.

English has only **two morphological tenses**: present and past. Future time is expressed through modals and aspect, not a distinct verb form.

| Tense | Marked by | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Present | base form or *-s* | *walk, walks* |
| Past | *-ed* or irregular form | *walked, went* |
| Future | modal *will* (no inflection) | *will walk* |

---

## 10.6 Present Tense

### Formation

**Regular verbs**:
- Base form: *I/you/we/they walk*
- Third person *-s*: *she/he/it walks*

**Spelling rules for *-s***:
- Most verbs: add *-s* (*walks, runs*)
- Ending in *-s, -sh, -ch, -x, -z*: add *-es* (*watches, fixes*)
- Consonant + *y*: change *y* to *-ies* (*studies, carries*)
- Irregular: *has, does, goes*

### Uses of Present Tense

**Habitual actions**:
- *She **walks** to school every day.*
- *I **drink** coffee in the morning.*

**General truths**:
- *Water **boils** at 100°C.*
- *The sun **rises** in the east.*

**States**:
- *She **knows** the answer.*
- *I **love** this city.*

**Scheduled future events**:
- *The train **leaves** at noon.*
- *The semester **starts** next week.*

**Performatives** (doing by saying):
- *I **apologize** for the delay.*
- *I **promise** to help.*

**Historical present** (in narratives):
- *So then he **walks** up and **says**...*

---

## 10.7 Past Tense

### Formation

**Regular verbs**: Add *-ed*
- *walk → walked*
- *play → played*
- *study → studied*

**Spelling rules for *-ed***:
- Most verbs: add *-ed* (*walked, played*)
- Ending in *-e*: add *-d* (*hoped, loved*)
- Consonant + *y*: change *y* to *-ied* (*studied, carried*)
- CVC ending (stressed): double final consonant (*stopped, planned*)

**Irregular verbs**: Various patterns
- Vowel change: *sing → sang*, *run → ran*
- Vowel change + consonant: *think → thought*, *bring → brought*
- No change: *cut → cut*, *put → put*
- Suppletive: *go → went*, *be → was/were*

### Uses of Past Tense

**Completed past events**:
- *She **walked** to school yesterday.*
- *The meeting **ended** at noon.*

**Past states**:
- *I **knew** the answer then.*
- *She **was** happy.*

**Hypotheticals/Counterfactuals** (not about past time):
- *If I **were** you, I would leave.* (but I'm not you)
- *I wish I **knew** the answer.* (but I don't)

**Polite requests** (not about past time):
- *I **wondered** if you could help.*
- ***Did** you want to order?*

---

## 10.8 Aspect: The Shape of Events

**Aspect** describes the internal temporal structure of events—whether they're completed, ongoing, repeated, or have current relevance. English has four aspects.

### Simple Aspect

The **simple aspect** presents events as complete wholes, without internal structure:

- *She **works** at a bank.* (present simple—habitual)
- *She **worked** at a bank.* (past simple—completed)
- *She **will work** at a bank.* (future simple—predicted)

### Progressive Aspect

The **progressive aspect** (be + *-ing*) presents events as ongoing, in progress:

- *She **is working** right now.* (present progressive)
- *She **was working** when I called.* (past progressive)
- *She **will be working** at noon.* (future progressive)

**Uses of progressive**:
- **Actions in progress**: *I'm reading a book.*
- **Temporary situations**: *She's living in Boston this year.*
- **Future arrangements**: *We're meeting tomorrow.*
- **Background to another event**: *I was sleeping when the phone rang.*

**Stative verbs** typically resist progressive:
- *~~I am knowing the answer.~~* → *I know the answer.*
- *~~She is loving chocolate.~~* → *She loves chocolate.*

### Perfect Aspect

The **perfect aspect** (have + past participle) connects a past event to a later time (often the present):

- *She **has worked** here for ten years.* (present perfect)
- *She **had worked** there before moving.* (past perfect)
- *By then, she **will have worked** here a decade.* (future perfect)

**Uses of present perfect**:
- **Past action with present relevance**: *I've finished my work.* (so I'm free now)
- **Experience up to now**: *She has visited Paris twice.*
- **Continuing situation**: *He has lived here since 2010.*
- **Recent past**: *They have just arrived.*

**Past perfect** positions events before another past reference point:
- *When I arrived, she **had already left**.*

### Perfect Progressive Aspect

The **perfect progressive** (have + been + *-ing*) combines perfect and progressive meanings:

- *She **has been working** all morning.* (present perfect progressive)
- *She **had been working** when I called.* (past perfect progressive)
- *By noon, she **will have been working** for six hours.* (future perfect progressive)

**Uses**:
- **Duration of ongoing activity**: *I've been waiting for an hour.*
- **Explanation for current state**: *She's tired because she's been running.*

## 10.9 Combining Tense and Aspect

Tense and aspect combine systematically:

| | Simple | Progressive | Perfect | Perfect Progressive |
|-|--------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Present** | walks | is walking | has walked | has been walking |
| **Past** | walked | was walking | had walked | had been walking |
| **Future** | will walk | will be walking | will have walked | will have been walking |

### Timeline Visualization

**Present simple** (*She works*): General truth, habit
```
Past -------|-------- Future
            NOW (habit/state)
```

**Present progressive** (*She is working*): Now, in progress
```
Past -------|======|- Future
            NOW (ongoing)
```

**Present perfect** (*She has worked*): Past connected to now
```
Past ===[event]==|-------- Future
                NOW (relevance)
```

**Past simple** (*She worked*): Completed, disconnected from now
```
Past --[event]--|-------- Future
              NOW
```
