## 17.1 Grammar and Style

Grammar isn't just about correctness—it's about choice. Every sentence offers multiple grammatically correct options, each with different stylistic effects.

### Style Defined

**Style** refers to the characteristic way a writer or speaker uses language. It emerges from patterns of choices: sentence length, word selection, active vs. passive voice, coordination vs. subordination.

Understanding grammar gives you options. Mastering style means knowing which options to choose and when.

## 17.2 Sentence Length and Complexity

### Varying Sentence Length

Effective prose mixes sentence lengths. Consider these two passages:

**Monotonous (all similar length)**:
*The storm arrived. It brought heavy rain. The roads flooded. Traffic stopped. People were stranded.*

**Varied**:
*The storm arrived with heavy rain, flooding the roads and bringing traffic to a halt. People were stranded.*

### When to Use Short Sentences

Short sentences create:
- **Impact**: *She refused.*
- **Clarity**: Complex information benefits from simpler structures
- **Pace**: Action scenes often use short, punchy sentences

### When to Use Long Sentences

Longer sentences create:
- **Flow**: Ideas that belong together can be combined
- **Rhythm**: Extended sentences can build to climactic points
- **Complexity**: Sophisticated relationships require more structure

### The Power of Variation

Short sentences stand out when surrounded by longer ones. The key is strategic contrast, not arbitrary mixture.

## 17.3 Active vs. Passive Voice

### Review

**Active**: The subject performs the action.
- *The committee **approved** the proposal.*

**Passive**: The subject receives the action.
- *The proposal **was approved** by the committee.*

### Choosing Active Voice

Use active voice when:

1. **The agent is important**: *The CEO announced the merger.*
2. **Directness is valued**: *We made a mistake.* (not *Mistakes were made.*)
3. **Energy is needed**: Active voice tends to be more dynamic.

### Choosing Passive Voice

Use passive voice when:

1. **The agent is unknown or irrelevant**: *The building was constructed in 1920.*
2. **The patient is the topic**: *The proposal—which I discussed earlier—was approved.*
3. **Objectivity is expected**: Scientific writing often uses passive.
4. **Tact is needed**: *Your request has been denied.* (softer than *We denied your request.*)

### Avoiding Passive Overuse

Excessive passive creates weak, evasive prose:
- *~~It was decided that changes would be made.~~*
- Better: *The committee decided to make changes.*

## 17.4 Information Structure

How you arrange information within a sentence affects clarity and emphasis.

### Given vs. New Information

**Given information**: What the reader already knows
**New information**: What you're adding

Effective prose moves from given to new:
- *The proposal was controversial. **This controversy** led to lengthy debates.*

The second sentence starts with the given information (*This controversy*) and ends with the new (*lengthy debates*).

### End-Focus

English naturally emphasizes information at the **end** of sentences:

- *The winner was **Maria**.* (emphasizes Maria)
- ***Maria** was the winner.* (emphasizes being the winner)

Place your most important information at the end.

### End-Weight

English prefers **heavy** (long, complex) elements at the end:

- Awkward: ***That she would resign** surprised everyone.*
- Better: *It surprised everyone **that she would resign**.*

This is why extraposition exists—to move heavy subjects to the end.

---

## 17.5 Emphasis Techniques

### Position

**Sentence-initial position** (topic position):
- Sets up what the sentence is about
- *As for the budget, we need to discuss it.*

**Sentence-final position** (focus position):
- Receives natural stress
- Place key information here

### Cleft Sentences

Clefts highlight specific elements:

- Normal: *John broke the window.*
- Cleft: ***It was John** who broke the window.* (emphasizes John)
- Pseudo-cleft: ***What John broke** was the window.* (emphasizes window)

### Inversion

Reversing normal word order creates emphasis:

- Normal: *The results were more surprising.*
- Inverted: ***More surprising** were the results.*

### Short Sentences for Punch

A short sentence after longer ones commands attention:

*The committee debated for hours, examining every proposal, questioning every assumption, reconsidering every priority. Then they voted. The answer was no.*

---

## 17.6 Coordination vs. Subordination

### When to Coordinate

Use coordination (*and*, *but*, *or*) when ideas are equally important:

*She studied hard, **and** she passed the exam.*

Coordination suggests balance and equal weight.

### When to Subordinate

Use subordination (*because*, *although*, *when*) when one idea supports another:

***Because** she studied hard, she passed the exam.*

Subordination highlights the main clause while providing context.

### Choosing Between Them

Compare:
- *She was tired, **but** she continued.* (equal weight—both facts matter)
- ***Although** she was tired, she continued.* (emphasis on continuing)

The choice depends on what you want to emphasize.

## 17.7 Rhetorical Sentence Patterns

### Loose (Cumulative) Sentences

The main clause comes first, followed by modifying elements:

*The ship sailed slowly, **rocking gently, its sails catching the wind, the crew relaxing on deck**.*

Loose sentences feel natural and relaxed.

### Periodic Sentences

Modifying elements come first, delaying the main clause:

***Rocking gently, its sails catching the wind, the crew relaxing on deck**, the ship sailed slowly.*

Periodic sentences build suspense and create emphasis.

### Balanced Sentences

Parallel structures create balance:

*Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.*

### Part 5: Revision and Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)

**11.** Find a paragraph from something you've written recently (an essay, email, or other document). Revise it by applying at least two techniques from this chapter:
- Varying sentence length
- Adjusting active/passive voice
- Improving given-to-new flow
- Using end-focus for emphasis

Original paragraph:

Revised paragraph:

Techniques applied and why:

**12.** The chapter argues that grammar is about *choice*, not just correctness. In 1-2 paragraphs, reflect: How does this perspective change how you think about your own writing? What stylistic choices have you been making unconsciously that you might now make more deliberately?

---

## Chapter Summary

- Grammar offers choices; style emerges from those choices.
- **Vary sentence length** for rhythm and emphasis.
- Choose **active voice** for directness; **passive voice** when the agent is less important.
- Move from **given to new** information; place emphasis at sentence end.
- Use **coordination** for equal ideas; **subordination** to highlight the main idea.
- Strategic sentence patterns (loose, periodic, balanced) create rhetorical effects.
