## 12.1 Adverbs vs. Adverbials: Form vs. Function

Understanding the distinction between **adverbs** (a form/part of speech) and **adverbials** (a function) is crucial for accurate grammatical analysis.

### Adverb as Form

An **adverb** is a part of speech—a word class with particular morphological and syntactic characteristics (Chapter 5). Adverbs often end in *-ly*, can modify verbs/adjectives/adverbs, and cannot appear between determiner and noun.

- *quickly*, *carefully*, *often*, *very*, *however*

### Adverbial as Function

An **adverbial** is any word, phrase, or clause that **functions** to modify a verb, adjective, adverb, or sentence. This is a functional category, not a form category.

**Key insight**: All adverbs functioning as modifiers are adverbials, but not all adverbials are adverbs.

---

## 12.2 Structures That Function as Adverbials

Many different structures can serve the adverbial function.

### 1. Adverb Phrases

The prototypical adverbial is an adverb phrase:

- *She spoke **quietly**.*
- *He arrived **very late**.*
- *They finished **remarkably quickly**.*

### 2. Prepositional Phrases

Prepositional phrases commonly function as adverbials:

- *She works **in the city**.* (place)
- *He arrived **at noon**.* (time)
- *They spoke **with enthusiasm**.* (manner)
- *We left **because of the weather**.* (reason)

### 3. Noun Phrases (Temporal/Spatial)

Certain noun phrases function adverbially, especially those indicating time or direction:

- *She arrived **yesterday**.* (time)
- *They met **last week**.* (time)
- *The bird flew **north**.* (direction)
- *We walked **two miles**.* (extent)

### 4. Adverb Clauses

Entire clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions function as adverbials:

- ***When the bell rang**, students left.* (time)
- *She succeeded **because she worked hard**.* (reason)
- ***Although it rained**, we continued.* (concession)
- ***If you need help**, call me.* (condition)

### 5. Infinitive Phrases

Infinitive phrases can function as adverbials (especially of purpose):

- *She came **to help**.* (purpose)
- *He studied hard **to pass the exam**.* (purpose)
- ***To succeed**, you must practice.* (purpose)

### 6. Participial Phrases

Participial phrases can function adverbially:

- ***Knowing the answer**, she raised her hand.* (reason/cause)
- *He left, **having finished his work**.* (time/reason)
- ***Exhausted**, she fell asleep.* (reason)

---

## 12.3 Semantic Roles of Adverbials

Adverbials are classified by the type of information they provide.

### Time Adverbials

Answer: *When? How long? How often?*

- *She arrived **yesterday**.* (point in time)
- *They talked **for hours**.* (duration)
- *He visits **often**.* (frequency)
- *We'll meet **before noon**.* (temporal reference)
- ***While I was sleeping**, someone called.* (clause)

### Place Adverbials

Answer: *Where? In what direction?*

- *She works **downtown**.*
- *They live **in Boston**.*
- *The cat jumped **onto the table**.*
- *He walked **toward the exit**.*
- ***Where the road ends**, the trail begins.* (clause)

### Manner Adverbials

Answer: *How? In what way?*

- *She spoke **quietly**.*
- *He handled it **with care**.*
- *They danced **gracefully**.*
- *She responded **as if she knew**.* (clause)

### Reason/Cause Adverbials

Answer: *Why? For what reason?*

- *She left **because of the noise**.*
- ***Because she was tired**, she went home.* (clause)
- ***Since you asked**, I'll explain.* (clause)
- ***Being tired**, she went home.* (participial)

### Purpose Adverbials

Answer: *For what purpose? Why?*

- *She came **for the meeting**.*
- *He exercises **to stay healthy**.* (infinitive)
- *She spoke quietly **so that no one would hear**.* (clause)
- ***In order to succeed**, you must practice.* (infinitive)

### Condition Adverbials

Answer: *Under what conditions?*

- ***If it rains**, we'll cancel.*
- ***Unless you study**, you won't pass.*
- ***Provided that you agree**, we can proceed.*
- ***In case of emergency**, call 911.*

### Concession Adverbials

Answer: *Despite what?*

- ***Although she tried**, she failed.*
- ***Even though it was expensive**, he bought it.*
- ***Despite the rain**, we continued.*
- *She succeeded, **though the odds were against her**.*

## 12.4 Types of Adverbials: Adjuncts, Disjuncts, and Conjuncts

Linguists distinguish three functional types of adverbials.

### Adjuncts

**Adjuncts** are integrated into clause structure, modifying the verb or clause content directly:

- *She spoke **quietly**.* (how she spoke)
- *He arrived **at noon**.* (when he arrived)
- *They live **in Boston**.* (where they live)

Adjuncts are part of the proposition—they can be focused, questioned, or negated:
- *She spoke QUIETLY.* (emphasis)
- *Did she speak quietly?* (question)
- *She didn't speak quietly.* (negation)

### Disjuncts

**Disjuncts** comment on the whole sentence from an external perspective, expressing the speaker's attitude or evaluating truth:

**Attitude/Stance disjuncts**:
- ***Unfortunately**, we lost.*
- ***Frankly**, I don't care.*
- ***Surprisingly**, she agreed.*
- ***Honestly**, I have no idea.*

**Truth/Domain disjuncts**:
- ***Clearly**, this is wrong.*
- ***Obviously**, he's guilty.*
- ***Technically**, it's legal.*
- ***Politically**, it's controversial.*

Disjuncts are not part of the proposition:
- *~~Did unfortunately we lose?~~* (cannot question)
- *It's not the case that unfortunately we lost.* (negation doesn't target the disjunct)

### Conjuncts

**Conjuncts** connect sentences or clauses, showing logical relationships:

- *She was tired. **However**, she continued.*
- *The evidence is strong. **Therefore**, we should proceed.*
- *First, read the instructions. **Then**, begin the test.*
- *I disagree. **Nevertheless**, I respect your view.*

Common conjuncts: *however*, *therefore*, *nevertheless*, *moreover*, *furthermore*, *consequently*, *thus*, *indeed*, *in fact*, *on the other hand*

## 12.5 Adverb Clause Structure

**Adverb clauses** are dependent clauses that function as adverbials, introduced by subordinating conjunctions.

### Structure

```
Adverb Clause = Subordinating Conjunction + Subject + Predicate
```

- ***When** [she arrived], we started.*
- ***Because** [the roads were icy], we drove slowly.*
- ***Although** [it was expensive], he bought it.*

### Common Subordinating Conjunctions

| Meaning | Conjunctions |
|---------|--------------|
| **Time** | *when, while, before, after, until, since, as, once, whenever, as soon as* |
| **Reason** | *because, since, as, given that, now that* |
| **Contrast** | *although, though, even though, while, whereas, even if* |
| **Condition** | *if, unless, provided that, as long as, in case* |
| **Purpose** | *so that, in order that* |
| **Result** | *so...that, such...that* |
| **Manner** | *as, as if, as though* |
| **Comparison** | *than, as...as* |

### Punctuation

**Adverb clause first**: comma after the clause
- ***When it rains**, we stay inside.*

**Adverb clause last**: usually no comma
- *We stay inside **when it rains**.*

---

## 12.6 Adverbial Position

Adverbials can appear in different positions, affecting emphasis and information flow.

### Initial Position

At the beginning of the sentence:
- ***Yesterday**, she arrived.*
- ***In the morning**, we'll leave.*
- ***Frankly**, I disagree.*

Initial position often signals topic or sets the scene.

### Medial Position

Between subject and verb, or within the verb phrase:
- *She **often** works late.*
- *He has **always** been reliable.*
- *They will **probably** arrive soon.*

Medial position is common for frequency adverbs and some manner adverbs.

### Final Position

At the end of the sentence:
- *She arrived **yesterday**.*
- *We'll leave **in the morning**.*
- *He spoke **quietly**.*

Final position is the default for many adverbials, especially manner and place.

### Position and Focus

Moving an adverbial to a different position can change emphasis:

- *She spoke quietly **in the library**.* (neutral)
- ***In the library**, she spoke quietly.* (library emphasized)
- *She spoke **in the library** quietly.* (quietness emphasized)
