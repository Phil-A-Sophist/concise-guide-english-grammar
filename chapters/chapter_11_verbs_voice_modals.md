## 11.1 Voice: Active and Passive

**Voice** is a grammatical category that describes the relationship between the verb and its arguments—specifically, who does the action and who receives it.

### Active Voice

In **active voice**, the subject performs the action:

- *The dog **bit** the man.* (subject = doer)
- *Maria **wrote** the report.* (subject = doer)
- *Someone **stole** my bicycle.* (subject = doer)

Active voice follows the pattern: **Agent (doer) + Verb + Patient (receiver)**

### Passive Voice

In **passive voice**, the subject receives the action:

- *The man **was bitten** by the dog.* (subject = receiver)
- *The report **was written** by Maria.* (subject = receiver)
- *My bicycle **was stolen**.* (subject = receiver)

Passive voice follows the pattern: **Patient (receiver) + *be* + past participle (+ *by* agent)**

### Forming the Passive

**Active → Passive transformation:**

1. The active object becomes the passive subject
2. Add appropriate form of *be*
3. Change the main verb to past participle
4. The active subject becomes optional *by*-phrase

| Active | Passive |
|--------|---------|
| *Maria wrote the report.* | *The report was written by Maria.* |
| *Someone stole my bike.* | *My bike was stolen.* |
| *They are building a house.* | *A house is being built.* |
| *She has finished the work.* | *The work has been finished.* |

### Passive with Tense and Aspect

Passive combines with all tenses and aspects:

| Tense-Aspect | Active | Passive |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Present simple | *writes* | *is written* |
| Past simple | *wrote* | *was written* |
| Present progressive | *is writing* | *is being written* |
| Past progressive | *was writing* | *was being written* |
| Present perfect | *has written* | *has been written* |
| Past perfect | *had written* | *had been written* |
| Future | *will write* | *will be written* |
| Modal | *can write* | *can be written* |

---

## 11.2 When to Use Passive Voice

Passive voice is often criticized, but it serves important functions.

### Appropriate Uses of Passive

**1. Agent is unknown or irrelevant:**
- *My car **was stolen** last night.* (who did it is unknown)
- *The building **was constructed** in 1920.* (builder not important)

**2. Focusing on the action or patient:**
- *The suspect **was arrested** at 3 a.m.*
- *Three errors **were discovered** in the code.*

**3. Scientific and academic writing** (for objectivity):
- *The samples **were analyzed** using spectroscopy.*
- *The data **were collected** over six months.*

**4. Avoiding blame or responsibility:**
- *Mistakes **were made**.* (who made them is obscured)

**5. Maintaining topic continuity:**
- *The report discussed several issues. These issues **were identified** by the committee.*

### When to Avoid Passive

**When agent is important:**
- Weak: *The decision **was made**.*
- Stronger: *The CEO **made** the decision.*

**When it creates confusion:**
- Confusing: *The proposal **was rejected** by the committee that **was formed** by the board.*
- Clearer: *The committee that the board formed **rejected** the proposal.*

**When active is more direct:**
- Passive: *The ball **was kicked** by the child.*
- Active: *The child **kicked** the ball.*

---

## 11.3 Get-Passive

English has an alternative passive formed with *get* instead of *be*:

- *He **got fired** last week.*
- *She **got promoted** to manager.*
- *They **got married** in June.*

**Get-passive** is more informal and often implies:
- Sudden or unexpected events: *He got hit by a car.*
- Events that affect the subject significantly: *She got accepted to Harvard.*
- Change of state: *The window got broken.*

---

## 11.4 Modal Auxiliaries

**Modal auxiliaries** add meanings related to possibility, necessity, permission, ability, and prediction. Unlike primary auxiliaries, modals have distinct grammatical properties.

### The Nine Modals

| Modal | Basic Meaning |
|-------|---------------|
| *can* | ability, possibility, permission |
| *could* | past ability, possibility, polite request |
| *will* | future, willingness, prediction |
| *would* | hypothetical, polite request, past habit |
| *shall* | future (formal), suggestion |
| *should* | obligation, expectation, advice |
| *may* | permission, possibility |
| *might* | possibility (weaker than *may*) |
| *must* | necessity, strong obligation, logical conclusion |

### Properties of Modals

1. **No *-s* in third person**: *She **can** go.* (not *~~She cans go~~*)
2. **No *to* infinitive**: *You **must** leave.* (not *~~You must to leave~~*)
3. **No past participle or *-ing* form**: *~~musted~~*, *~~musting~~*
4. **Cannot combine directly**: *~~She can must go~~*
5. **Form questions by inversion**: ***Can** she go?*
6. **Form negatives with *not***: *She **cannot** go.*

## 11.5 Modal Meanings in Detail

### *Can* and *Could*

**Ability**:
- *She **can** speak French.* (present ability)
- *She **could** speak French when she was young.* (past ability)

**Possibility**:
- *It **can** get cold here in winter.* (general possibility)
- *That **could** be true.* (specific possibility)

**Permission**:
- ***Can** I leave early?* (informal)
- ***Could** I borrow your pen?* (polite)

### *Will* and *Would*

**Future**:
- *I **will** call you tomorrow.*
- *She **will** be at the meeting.*

**Willingness**:
- ***Will** you help me?*
- *I **won't** tolerate that behavior.*

**Hypothetical/Conditional**:
- *I **would** go if I had time.*
- *What **would** you do?*

**Polite requests**:
- ***Would** you close the door?*

**Past habit**:
- *We **would** go fishing every summer.*

### *Shall* and *Should*

**Shall** (formal, mostly British):
- ***Shall** I open the window?* (offer)
- *We **shall** overcome.* (determination)

**Should** (obligation, expectation):
- *You **should** apologize.* (advice/obligation)
- *She **should** arrive soon.* (expectation)
- *If you **should** need help, call me.* (hypothetical)

### *May* and *Might*

**Permission** (*may*):
- ***May** I come in?* (formal)
- *You **may** leave when finished.*

**Possibility**:
- *It **may** rain tomorrow.* (possible)
- *It **might** rain tomorrow.* (less certain)
- *She **may** have forgotten.* (possible past)

### *Must*

**Necessity/Obligation**:

- *Visitors **must** sign in.*

**Logical conclusion**:
- *She's not answering—she **must** be asleep.*
- *He **must** have left already.* (deduction about past)

**Note**: For negation, *must not* means prohibition (*You must not enter*), while *don't have to* means lack of necessity (*You don't have to enter*).

---

## 11.6 Epistemic vs. Deontic Modality

Modals express two main types of meaning:

### Epistemic Modality

**Epistemic modality** concerns knowledge, belief, and certainty about whether something is true:

- *She **must** be home.* (I conclude this)
- *He **might** know the answer.* (possibly)
- *That **can't** be right.* (impossibility)

### Deontic Modality

**Deontic modality** concerns obligation, permission, and necessity for action:

- *You **must** leave now.* (obligation)
- *You **may** enter.* (permission)
- ***Can** I go?* (asking permission)

The same modal can have both meanings:

- *You **must** be tired.* (epistemic—I deduce you're tired)
- *You **must** rest.* (deontic—I'm telling you to rest)

---

## 11.7 Semi-Modals (Quasi-Modals)

**Semi-modals** are multi-word expressions that function like modals but don't share all their grammatical properties.

### Common Semi-Modals

| Semi-modal | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| *have to* | necessity | *I **have to** leave.* |
| *have got to* | necessity (informal) | *I'**ve got to** go.* |
| *be able to* | ability | *She'**s able to** help.* |
| *be going to* | future intention | *I'**m going to** study.* |
| *be supposed to* | expectation/obligation | *You'**re supposed to** wait.* |
| *be allowed to* | permission | *We'**re allowed to** leave.* |
| *ought to* | obligation | *You **ought to** apologize.* |
| *used to* | past habit | *I **used to** live there.* |

### Semi-modals vs. True Modals

Unlike true modals, semi-modals:
- Can be inflected: *She **has to** go.* (third person *-s*)
- Can follow other modals: *You **will have to** leave.*
- Can take *-ing* or infinitive forms: *Having to leave upset her.*

---

## 11.8 Modal Perfect

Modals combine with *have* + past participle to refer to past time or to express degrees of certainty about the past:

**Modal + have + past participle**:

- *She **must have left**.* (I conclude she left)
- *He **might have forgotten**.* (possibly he forgot)
- *You **should have called**.* (but you didn't—criticism)
- *I **would have helped** if I could.* (hypothetical past)
- *They **could have won**.* (they had the ability but didn't)

### Meanings of Modal Perfect

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| *must have done* | logical conclusion about past |
| *may/might have done* | possibility in the past |
| *could have done* | past possibility or unrealized ability |
| *should have done* | obligation not fulfilled (criticism) |
| *would have done* | hypothetical past (unfulfilled) |
| *can't have done* | impossibility in the past |
