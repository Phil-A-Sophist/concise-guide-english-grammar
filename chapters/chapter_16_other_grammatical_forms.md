## 16.1 Nonfinite Verb Forms

Verbs can be **finite** or **nonfinite**. **Finite verbs** are marked for tense and agree with their subjects. **Nonfinite verbs** lack tense marking and cannot serve as the main verb of an independent clause.

### Three Types of Nonfinite Forms

| Form | Example | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Infinitive** | *(to) write* | Base form, with or without *to* |
| **Gerund/Present Participle** | *writing* | *-ing* form |
| **Past Participle** | *written* | *-ed* or irregular form |

### Infinitives

**To-infinitive**: *to* + base verb
- *She wants **to leave**.*
- *It's important **to practice**.*

**Bare infinitive**: base verb without *to*
- *She can **leave**.* (after modals)
- *Let him **go**.* (after *let*, *make*, *have*)
- *I saw her **leave**.* (after perception verbs)

### Gerunds and Present Participles

The *-ing* form serves two functions:

**Gerund** (nominal function):
- ***Swimming** is fun.* (subject)
- *She enjoys **reading**.* (object)

**Present participle** (adjectival/adverbial function):
- *the **running** water* (adjectival)
- ***Knowing** the answer, she raised her hand.* (adverbial)

**Progressive auxiliary**:
- *She **is writing**.* (part of verb phrase)

### Past Participles

The past participle (*-ed* or irregular) serves several functions:

**Perfect auxiliary**:
- *She **has written** a book.*

**Passive auxiliary**:
- *The book **was written** by her.*

**Adjectival**:
- *the **broken** window*
- *a book **written** by Hemingway*

## 16.2 Complement Clauses

**Complement clauses** complete the meaning of verbs, adjectives, or nouns. They differ from relative clauses (which modify) and adverb clauses (which provide circumstantial information).

### Verb Complements

Many verbs take clausal complements:

**That-clauses**:
- *I believe **that she's honest**.*
- *He admitted **that he was wrong**.*

**Infinitive clauses**:
- *She wants **to leave**.*
- *He persuaded her **to stay**.*

**Gerund clauses**:
- *She enjoys **swimming**.*
- *He denied **stealing the money**.*

**Wh-clauses**:
- *I wonder **what she said**.*
- *Tell me **how you did it**.*

### Raising vs. Control

Some verbs allow special subject relationships:

**Raising** (subject "raised" from complement):
- *She seems **to be happy**.* (*she* is really the subject of *be happy*)
- *It appears **that she's happy**.*

**Control** (subject "controls" reference in complement):
- *She promised **to help**.* (*she* will help—subject control)
- *She persuaded him **to help**.* (*him* will help—object control)

### Adjective Complements

Adjectives can also take complement clauses:

- *I'm glad **that you came**.*
- *She's eager **to help**.*
- *He's afraid **of failing**.*

### Noun Complements

Nouns derived from verbs can take similar complements:

- *her belief **that honesty matters***
- *his desire **to succeed***
- *the fact **that she resigned***

---

## 16.3 Special Constructions

English has several special sentence constructions that manipulate information structure.

### Cleft Sentences

**Cleft sentences** split a simple sentence to highlight specific information.

**It-clefts** (focus on one element):
- Base: *John ate the cake.*
- Cleft: ***It was John** who ate the cake.* (focus on John)
- Cleft: ***It was the cake** that John ate.* (focus on cake)

**Wh-clefts** (pseudo-clefts):
- ***What John ate** was the cake.*
- ***What she wants** is a vacation.*
- ***The thing I need** is help.*

Clefts emphasize the focused element and presuppose the rest.

### Existential Sentences

**Existential sentences** introduce new referents into discourse, typically beginning with *there*:

- ***There is** a book on the table.*
- ***There are** three students waiting.*
- ***There seems to be** a problem.*

The *there* is expletive (meaningless placeholder), not the locative adverb *there*.

### Extraposition

**Extraposition** moves a heavy subject clause to the end, using *it* as placeholder:

- Original: ***That she resigned** surprised everyone.*
- Extraposed: ***It** surprised everyone **that she resigned**.*

- Original: ***To explain everything** would take too long.*
- Extraposed: ***It** would take too long **to explain everything**.*

Extraposition improves processing by avoiding long subjects.

### Topicalization

**Topicalization** moves an element to sentence-initial position for emphasis:

- Base: *I never liked that movie.*
- Topicalized: ***That movie**, I never liked.*

- Base: *She's talented, not lucky.*
- Topicalized: ***Talented** she is, not lucky.*

## 16.4 Coordination

**Coordination** joins elements of equal status using coordinating conjunctions.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

*and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *yet*, *so*

### What Can Be Coordinated

Virtually any grammatical category can be coordinated:

**Words**:
- *cats **and** dogs* (nouns)
- *tall **and** handsome* (adjectives)
- *quickly **but** carefully* (adverbs)

**Phrases**:
- *in the house **or** in the garden* (PPs)
- *reading books **and** watching movies* (gerund phrases)

**Clauses**:
- *She sings **and** he dances.*
- *I tried **but** I failed.*

### Parallel Structure

Coordinated elements should be grammatically parallel:

- ✓ *She likes **swimming** and **hiking**.* (gerunds)
- ✗ *~~She likes **swimming** and **to hike**.~~* (mixed forms)

- ✓ *He is **tall**, **dark**, and **handsome**.* (all adjectives)
- ✗ *~~He is **tall**, **dark**, and **has a beard**.~~* (mixed)

### Correlative Conjunctions

Paired conjunctions that work together:

- *both...and*: ***Both** John **and** Mary attended.*
- *either...or*: ***Either** we leave now **or** we wait.*
- *neither...nor*: ***Neither** the teacher **nor** the students knew.*
- *not only...but also*: *She's **not only** smart **but also** kind.*

---

## 16.5 Ellipsis

**Ellipsis** is the omission of words recoverable from context, avoiding redundancy.

### VP Ellipsis

The verb phrase can be omitted after an auxiliary:

- *She can swim, and he can **[swim]** too.*
- *She hasn't arrived, but he has **[arrived]**.*
- *They want to leave, and we do **[want to leave]** too.*

### Gapping

In coordinated clauses, the second verb can be omitted:

- *John ordered coffee, and Mary **[ordered]** tea.*
- *She plays piano, and he **[plays]** guitar.*

### Sluicing

In questions, everything but the wh-word can be omitted:

- *Someone called, but I don't know who **[called]**.*
- *She bought something, but I'm not sure what **[she bought]**.*

### Noun Phrase Ellipsis

Part of an NP can be omitted:

- *I prefer the red shirt, not the blue **[shirt]**.*
- *Some students passed; others **[students]** failed.*

---

## 16.6 Other Notable Structures

### Comparative Constructions

Comparatives use special structures:

- *She is **taller than** he (is).*
- *She runs **as fast as** her brother (does).*
- ***The more** you practice, **the better** you get.*

### Questions

Questions have distinctive word order:

**Yes-no questions** (subject-auxiliary inversion):
- Statement: *She **can** swim.*
- Question: ***Can** she swim?*

**Wh-questions** (wh-movement + inversion):
- Statement: *She read something.*
- Question: ***What** did she read?*

### Negation

Negation typically involves *not* with an auxiliary:

- *She **does not** understand.*
- *They **have not** arrived.*
- *He **cannot** come.*

With no auxiliary, *do* is inserted:
- *She understands.* → *She **does not** understand.*

### Part 4: Analysis and Application (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Read the passage and answer the questions.

#### Passage:

*What surprised the investigators was the lack of evidence. There were no witnesses. Having examined the scene, they concluded that the crime had been carefully planned. It was clear that someone with inside knowledge was responsible. To identify this person would require additional investigation.*

**11.** Identify all nonfinite verb forms in the passage and classify each as infinitive, gerund, or participle.

**12.** Identify one example of each construction type in the passage: a cleft sentence, an existential sentence, and extraposition.

**13.** The passage begins with a wh-cleft ("What surprised the investigators was the lack of evidence"). Rewrite this sentence in two other ways:

a) As a simple sentence (no cleft):

b) As an it-cleft:

**14.** Why might a writer choose to use a cleft sentence or extraposition rather than a simpler construction? In 2-3 sentences, explain the stylistic effects these constructions create.
