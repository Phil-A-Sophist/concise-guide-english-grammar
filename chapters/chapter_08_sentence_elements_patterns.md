## 8.1 The Two Core Parts: Subject and Predicate

Every complete sentence has two fundamental parts: a **subject** and a **predicate**.

### The Subject

The **subject** is what the sentence is about—typically who or what performs the action or is described. The subject is usually a noun phrase.

**Examples:**
- ***The tall man** walked slowly.*
- ***Three ambitious students from Pueblo** study hard.*
- ***Swimming** is fun.*
- ***What she said** surprised everyone.*

**Finding the subject:**
- Ask "Who or what [verb]?"
- *The tall man walked.* → Who walked? → *The tall man*

### The Predicate

The **predicate** is everything that is said about the subject. It always includes a verb phrase and may include objects, complements, and adverbials.

**Examples:**
- *The tall man **walked slowly**.*
- *Three students **study in the library every evening**.*
- *She **is a talented musician from Argentina**.*

**The predicate includes:**
- The main verb (required)
- Objects and complements (depending on verb type)
- Adverbials (optional)

### Subject-Predicate Division

Every sentence divides into these two parts:

| Subject | Predicate |
|---------|-----------|
| *Dogs* | *bark.* |
| *The young artist* | *painted beautiful landscapes.* |
| *My neighbor's daughter from next door* | *won the competition last week.* |

---

## 8.2 Complements: Objects and Subject Complements

**Complements** are elements required by the verb to complete the sentence's meaning. They differ from adverbials, which are optional.

### Direct Objects

The **direct object** receives the action of the verb. It answers "What?" or "Whom?"

**Examples:**
- *Weasels stalk **rabbits**.* (stalk what? → rabbits)
- *She read **the book**.* (read what? → the book)
- *I saw **him**.* (saw whom? → him)

Direct objects are always noun phrases (or clauses functioning as NPs).

### Indirect Objects

The **indirect object** indicates the recipient or beneficiary of the action. It answers "To whom?" or "For whom?"

**Examples:**
- *Marie sent **Ramon** a birthday gift.* (sent to whom? → Ramon)
- *She gave **me** the book.* (gave to whom? → me)
- *He told **the students** a story.* (told to whom? → the students)

Indirect objects:
- Appear between the verb and direct object
- Are always noun phrases
- Can be rephrased with *to* or *for*: *She gave the book **to me**.*

### Subject Complements

A **subject complement** describes or identifies the subject. It follows a linking verb (*be*, *become*, *seem*, *appear*, *feel*, etc.).

**Examples:**
- *I am **an optimist**.* (NP—identifies subject)
- *The writers are **very cold**.* (AdjP—describes subject)
- *He seems **in trouble**.* (PP—describes subject)

Subject complements can be:
- Noun phrases: *She is **a nurse**.*
- Adjective phrases: *The trail looked **steep**.*
- Prepositional phrases: *He seems **in good spirits**.*

### Object Complements

An **object complement** describes or identifies the direct object. It follows certain transitive verbs.

**Examples:**
- *The director considered the performance **a success**.* (NP—identifies DO)
- *The critic called the acting **brilliant**.* (AdjP—describes DO)
- *They elected her **president**.* (NP—identifies DO)

Object complements can be noun phrases or adjective phrases.

---

## 8.3 Arguments vs. Adverbials

Understanding the difference between **arguments** (required elements) and **adverbials** (optional elements) is crucial for sentence analysis.

### Arguments

**Arguments** are the elements that a verb requires to form a complete, grammatical sentence. They include:
- Subject (required for all sentences)
- Direct object (for transitive verbs)
- Indirect object (for ditransitive verbs)
- Subject complement (for linking verbs)
- Object complement (for some transitive verbs)

**Test:** If you remove an argument, the sentence becomes ungrammatical or changes meaning dramatically.

*She put the book on the table.*
- Remove *the book*: *~~She put on the table.~~* ✗
- Remove *on the table*: *~~She put the book.~~* ✗
- All three elements are arguments of *put*.

### Adverbials

**Adverbials** provide additional information about time, place, manner, reason, etc. They are optional—the sentence is grammatical without them.

**Examples:**
- *Accidents happen **on Mondays**.* (when)
- *She spoke **quietly**.* (how)
- ***Unfortunately**, we lost.* (attitude)
- *He works **at the hospital** **every day**.* (where, when)

**Test:** If you remove an adverbial, the sentence remains grammatical.

*She spoke quietly in the library.*
- Remove *quietly*: *She spoke in the library.* ✓
- Remove *in the library*: *She spoke quietly.* ✓
- Both are adverbials—optional modifiers.

### Distinguishing Arguments from Adverbials

| Arguments | Adverbials |
|-----------|------------|
| Required by verb | Optional |
| Limited in number per verb | Unlimited |
| Cannot be moved as freely | Often movable |
| Removal changes grammaticality | Removal leaves grammatical sentence |

**Compare:**
- *She put the book **on the table**.* (argument—required by *put*)
- *She read the book **on the table**.* (adverbial—optional location)

---

## 8.4 Verb Valency

**Valency** refers to the number and types of arguments a verb requires. Different verbs have different valencies, and this determines sentence structure.

### The Verb as the Sentence's Architect

The main verb determines what other elements must appear in the sentence. Think of the verb as an architect's blueprint—it specifies how many "slots" need to be filled and what types of elements fill them.

- *Sleep* requires only a subject (1 argument)
- *Read* typically requires a subject and object (2 arguments)
- *Give* requires a subject, indirect object, and direct object (3 arguments)

### Valency Categories

**Intransitive Verbs (Valency: 1)**

Require only a subject:
- *Cameras **flashed**.*
- *The baby **slept**.*
- *Accidents **happen**.*

**Transitive Verbs (Valency: 2)**

Require a subject and a direct object:
- *Weasels **stalk** rabbits.*
- *She **read** the book.*
- *They **completed** the project.*

**Ditransitive Verbs (Valency: 3)**

Require a subject, direct object, and indirect object (or object complement):
- *Marie **sent** Ramon a gift.* (S + IO + DO)
- *She **gave** me the book.* (S + IO + DO)
- *The director **considered** the performance a success.* (S + DO + OC)

**Linking Verbs (Valency: 2)**

Require a subject and subject complement:
- *She **is** a doctor.* (S + SC)
- *The trail **looked** steep.* (S + SC)
- *He **became** president.* (S + SC)

### Verbs with Variable Valency

Some verbs can be used with different valencies:

**Eat:**
- Intransitive: *We ate.* (1 argument)
- Transitive: *We ate dinner.* (2 arguments)

**Give:**
- Ditransitive: *She gave me a book.* (3 arguments)
- Transitive + PP: *She gave a book to me.* (2 arguments + PP adverbial)

**Run:**
- Intransitive: *She runs.* (1 argument)
- Transitive: *She runs a business.* (2 arguments)

## 8.5 The Six Sentence Patterns

Every complete sentence in English follows one of six basic structural patterns. These patterns are determined by verb type and required elements.

### Pattern 1: Intransitive (S + V)

**Structure:** Subject + Verb

**Intransitive verbs** express complete actions or states without needing a receiver.

| Subject | Verb |
|---------|------|
| Thunder | rumbled |
| My grandmother | sneezed |
| The toast | burned |
| Her voice | trembled |

**What makes it intransitive?**
The verb alone completes the thought. Adverbials can be added but are not required:
- *Thunder rumbled **across the valley**.* (still intransitive)
- *My grandmother sneezed **violently**.* (still intransitive)

**Exclusively intransitive verbs:**
*arrive*, *collapse*, *disappear*, *emerge*, *exist*, *fall*, *hesitate*, *occur*, *sneeze*, *vanish*

You cannot say *~~She arrived the station~~* or *~~The building collapsed the roof~~*.

### Pattern 2: Copular *Be* (S + *Be* + SC)

**Structure:** Subject + *Be* + Subject Complement

The verb **be** links the subject to a **subject complement**—a word or phrase that describes or identifies the subject.

| Subject | Be | Subject Complement | Type |
|---------|----|--------------------|------|
| She | is | a violinist | NP |
| The solution | was | surprisingly simple | AdjP |
| My keys | are | under the cushion | PP |
| Tomorrow | will be | Tuesday | NP |

**Three types of subject complements:**

- **Noun Phrase (NP)**: Identifies who/what the subject is
  - *Marcus **is a carpenter**.*

- **Adjective Phrase (AdjP)**: Describes a quality of the subject
  - *The water **is cold**.*

- **Prepositional Phrase (PP)**: Locates or describes the subject
  - *The restaurant **is around the corner**.*

### Pattern 3: Linking Verb (S + LV + SC)

**Structure:** Subject + Linking Verb + Subject Complement

**Linking verbs** work like *be*—they connect the subject to a complement that describes or identifies it.

| Subject | Linking Verb | Subject Complement | Type |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|----- |
| The bread | smells | wonderful | AdjP |
| Her excuse | sounded | plausible | AdjP |
| That musician | became | famous | AdjP |
| The caterpillar | became | a butterfly | NP |

**The substitution test:**
If you can replace the verb with a form of *be* and the sentence still makes sense, the verb is linking:
- *The bread smells wonderful.* → *The bread **is** wonderful.* ✓ (Linking)
- *The detective smells trouble.* → *The detective **is** trouble.* ✗ (Not linking—transitive!)

**Common linking verbs:**
*appear*, *become*, *feel*, *get*, *grow*, *look*, *prove*, *remain*, *seem*, *smell*, *sound*, *stay*, *taste*, *turn*

**Warning**: Many of these verbs can also be transitive:
- *She **felt** nervous.* (linking—"nervous" describes "she")
- *She **felt** the fabric.* (transitive—"fabric" is a direct object)

### Pattern 4: Transitive (S + V + DO)

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Direct Object

**Transitive verbs** require a direct object—an NP that receives the action.

| Subject | Verb | Direct Object |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Squirrels | gather | acorns |
| The tornado | destroyed | the barn |
| Nobody | expected | this outcome |
| Lightning | struck | the old oak |

**Direct object tests:**
1. Ask "verb what?" or "verb whom?": *Squirrels gather **what**?* → *acorns*
2. Pronoun replacement: *She finished her dissertation.* → *She finished **it**.*
3. Passive transformation: *Lightning struck the oak.* → *The oak was struck.*

### Pattern 5: Ditransitive (S + V + IO + DO)

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object

Some transitive verbs take two objects: an **indirect object** (the recipient) followed by a **direct object** (the thing transferred).

| Subject | Verb | Indirect Object | Direct Object |
|---------|------|-----------------|---------------|
| The librarian | handed | me | a book |
| She | told | the children | a story |
| The company | offered | employees | free parking |
| The chef | made | us | a special dessert |

**Identifying indirect objects:**
1. **To/For paraphrase**: You can rephrase with "to" or "for":
   - *The librarian handed me a book.* → *...handed a book **to me**.*
   - *The chef made us a dessert.* → *...made a dessert **for us**.*

2. **Order matters**: IO comes before DO

**Common ditransitive verbs:**
*award*, *bring*, *buy*, *cook*, *give*, *grant*, *hand*, *lend*, *make*, *offer*, *owe*, *pass*, *pay*, *promise*, *read*, *sell*, *send*, *show*, *teach*, *tell*, *throw*, *write*

### Pattern 6: Ditransitive (S + V + DO + OC)

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Direct Object + Object Complement

Some verbs take a direct object followed by an **object complement**—a word or phrase that describes or identifies the direct object.

| Subject | Verb | Direct Object | Object Complement | Type |
|---------|------|---------------|-------------------|------|
| The jury | found | her | guilty | AdjP |
| Critics | called | the film | a masterpiece | NP |
| The heat | made | everyone | irritable | AdjP |
| They | elected | her | president | NP |

**Distinguishing Pattern 5 from Pattern 6:**

- **Pattern 5 (IO + DO)**: The two NPs refer to *different* things:
  - *She gave **Marcus** **a book**.* (Marcus ≠ book)

- **Pattern 6 (DO + OC)**: The complement describes or equals the DO:
  - *They elected **her** **president**.* (her = president)

**Common DO + OC verbs:**
*appoint*, *believe*, *call*, *consider*, *declare*, *deem*, *elect*, *find*, *keep*, *label*, *leave*, *make*, *name*, *paint*, *prove*, *render*, *think*

## 8.6 A Systematic Approach to Pattern Identification

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find the main verb** (not auxiliaries like *has*, *will*, *been*)

2. **Identify the subject** (the NP before the verb)

3. **Set aside adverbials** (time, place, manner, reason phrases)

4. **Check for *be* first** → If yes, Pattern 2 (Copular Be)

5. **Apply the *be* substitution test** → If it works, Pattern 3 (Linking)

6. **Examine what follows the verb**:
   - Nothing → Pattern 1 (Intransitive)
   - One NP → Pattern 4 (Transitive)
   - Two NPs or NP + AdjP → Continue to step 7

7. **For two elements after the verb, ask**: Do they refer to the same thing?
   - Same thing → Pattern 6 (DO + OC)
   - Different things → Pattern 5 (IO + DO)

### Worked Example

**Sentence**: *On Tuesday, the committee unanimously declared the proposal inadequate.*

1. Main verb: *declared*
2. Subject: *the committee*
3. Adverbials: *On Tuesday* (time), *unanimously* (manner)—set aside
4. Is it *be*? No
5. *Be* substitution: Not applicable here
6. What follows verb: *the proposal* (NP) + *inadequate* (AdjP)
7. Same thing? Yes—the proposal is described as inadequate

**Answer: Pattern 6 (DO + OC)**

---

## 8.7 Common Misconceptions

### "Adverbials change the pattern"

**Wrong**: *The birds sang beautifully in the garden.* = Pattern 4?

**Right**: Adverbials don't affect pattern. Remove them: *The birds sang.* = Pattern 1 (Intransitive)

### "A PP after the verb means transitive"

**Wrong**: *She walked to the store.* = Transitive with "the store" as object?

**Right**: "To the store" is a PP functioning as adverbial. Pattern 1 (Intransitive)

### "Long sentences must be complex patterns"

**Wrong**: A long sentence must be Pattern 5 or 6?

**Right**: Length doesn't determine pattern. *The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya who had trained for years finally collapsed at the finish line* is still Pattern 1 (Intransitive).

### "Linking verbs are always linking"

**Wrong**: "Feel" is always linking?

**Right**: Many verbs can be linking OR transitive:
- *The silk **feels** smooth.* (Pattern 3—linking)
- *She **felt** the bump.* (Pattern 4—transitive)

## Homework: Basic Sentence Elements and Sentence Patterns

---

### Part 1: Sentence Element Identification (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each sentence, identify the requested elements.

#### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *The talented chef from France prepared us an exquisite meal in the kitchen.*

Subject NP: *The talented chef from France*
Main verb: *prepared*
Indirect object: *us*
Direct object: *an exquisite meal*
Adverbial: *in the kitchen*

---

**1.** *The ambitious young researcher from the university laboratory discovered a remarkable solution.*

Subject NP:

Predicate:

Main verb:

Direct object:

**2.** Identify all complements (DO, IO, SC, OC) in each sentence:

a) *The committee awarded the outstanding student a prestigious scholarship.*

b) *The homemade soup tasted absolutely delicious.*

c) *The judges declared the young contestant the winner.*

**3.** For each underlined element, indicate whether it is an argument (required by the verb) or an adverbial (optional modifier):

a) *She placed the documents **on the desk**.*

b) *She found the documents **on the desk**.*

c) *The professor is **extremely knowledgeable about linguistics**.*

d) *The professor lectured **extremely knowledgeably about linguistics**.*

---

### Part 2: Sentence Completion (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Complete each sentence by adding the requested element.

---

**4.** Add a direct object to create a transitive sentence:

*The dedicated students completed __________.*

**5.** Add an indirect object AND a direct object to create a ditransitive sentence:

*The generous donor gave __________.*

**6.** Add a subject complement to create a linking verb sentence:

*After the long hike, the exhausted climbers seemed __________.*

**7.** Add an object complement:

*The board of directors elected her __________.*

---

### Part 3: Sentence Pattern Identification (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Identify the sentence pattern (1-6) for each sentence and explain your reasoning. Remember to set aside adverbials before determining the pattern.

**Sentence Patterns:**
- Pattern 1: Intransitive (S + V)
- Pattern 2: Copular *be* (S + *be* + SC)
- Pattern 3: Linking verb (S + LV + SC)
- Pattern 4: Transitive (S + V + DO)
- Pattern 5: Ditransitive (S + V + IO + DO)
- Pattern 6: Ditransitive (S + V + DO + OC)

#### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *The ancient lighthouse still stands on the rocky cliff.*

Pattern: Pattern 1 (Intransitive)

Explanation: The main verb is "stands." "On the rocky cliff" is an adverbial (optional—answers "where?"). "Still" is also an adverbial. Without the adverbials, we have "The ancient lighthouse stands"—a complete sentence with just a subject and intransitive verb. "Stands" does not require an object or complement.

### Part 4: Sentence Writing (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Write original sentences following each pattern. Underline or label the key elements (S, V, DO, IO, SC, OC).

---

**13.** Write a sentence following Pattern 4 (transitive: S + V + DO):

**14.** Write a sentence following Pattern 5 (ditransitive with IO + DO: S + V + IO + DO):

**15.** Write a sentence following Pattern 6 (ditransitive with DO + OC: S + V + DO + OC):

---

### Part 5: Analysis and Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Read the sentences below and answer the questions.

---

**16.** The verb *put* is unusual because it requires TWO arguments beyond the subject. Analyze the following sentences:

a) *She put the book on the shelf.*

What happens if you remove "the book"?

What happens if you remove "on the shelf"?

What does this tell you about the valency of *put*?

**17.** Some verbs can be either linking or transitive depending on context. Analyze these pairs:

a) *The milk smells sour.* vs. *The detective smells trouble.*

Which sentence has a linking verb? Which has a transitive verb?

How can you tell? (Hint: Apply the *be* substitution test.)

**18.** In 3-4 sentences, explain how you distinguish between an argument and an adverbial when analyzing sentences. Why does this distinction matter for identifying sentence patterns? Give an example to illustrate.

## Chapter Summary

- Every sentence has a **subject** (what it's about) and **predicate** (what's said about the subject).
- **Complements** are required elements: direct objects, indirect objects, subject complements, and object complements.
- **Adverbials** are optional modifiers providing time, place, manner, or reason information.
- Verb **valency** refers to the number of arguments a verb requires.
- English sentences follow **six basic patterns** determined by verb type:
  1. **Intransitive**: S + V
  2. **Copular *be***: S + *be* + SC
  3. **Linking**: S + LV + SC
  4. **Transitive**: S + V + DO
  5. **Ditransitive (IO + DO)**: S + V + IO + DO
  6. **Ditransitive (DO + OC)**: S + V + DO + OC
- Adverbials can appear in any pattern without changing the pattern classification.
