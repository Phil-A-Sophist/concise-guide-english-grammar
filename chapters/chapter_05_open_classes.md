## 5.1 Form vs. Function: The Foundation of Grammatical Analysis

Before examining specific word classes, we need to establish the most important distinction in grammar: the difference between **form** and **function**. This distinction underlies everything else in grammatical analysis, and mastering it early will prevent countless errors.

### The Two Questions

When analyzing any word in a sentence, you must ask two separate questions:

1. **What IS this word?** (form)
2. **What is this word DOING?** (function)

These questions have different answers, and both answers matter.

### Form: What a Word IS

**Form** refers to a word's part of speech—its inherent grammatical category. We determine form by examining the word's morphological properties (what endings it can take) and its typical syntactic behavior.

For example, *happy* is an adjective. How do we know? Because it passes the tests for adjectives:
- It can be compared: *happier*, *happiest*
- It can be modified by *very*: *very happy*
- It can appear after linking verbs: *She seems happy*

These properties belong to the word itself, regardless of how it's used in any particular sentence.

### Function: What a Word DOES

**Function** refers to the grammatical role a word plays in a specific sentence. The same word can perform different functions in different sentences—and sometimes a word's function differs from what we'd expect based on its form.

Consider the word *poor*:

*The **poor** deserve our help.*

What is *poor*? By form, it's an adjective (it can be graded: *poorer*, *poorest*). But what is it doing in this sentence? It's functioning as a noun—it follows a determiner (*the*), it serves as the subject of the sentence, and it refers to a group of people. We call this an **adjective functioning nominally** (doing the job of a noun).

### The Dual-Identification Principle

**When analyzing grammar, always identify both form AND function.**

This principle will guide you through the rest of this chapter and the rest of this book. Whenever you encounter a word, don't stop at one label. Ask both questions.

Let's see more examples:

**Example 1: Form and function match**

*She spoke **quietly**.*

- Form: *quietly* is an adverb (formed with *-ly* from adjective *quiet*)
- Function: *quietly* functions adverbially (it modifies the verb *spoke*, telling us how she spoke)

Here form and function align—an adverb doing adverb work.

**Example 2: Form and function differ**

*The **coffee** table needs dusting.*

- Form: *coffee* is a noun (it can be pluralized: *coffees*; it can follow determiners: *the coffee*)
- Function: *coffee* functions adjectivally (it modifies *table*, telling us what kind of table)

Here a noun is doing the work typically done by adjectives.

**Example 3: Another mismatch**

*She runs **fast**.*

- Form: *fast* is typically an adjective (*a fast car*, *faster*, *fastest*)
- Function: *fast* functions adverbially (it modifies *runs*, telling us how she runs)

### Why This Matters

The form/function distinction matters for three reasons:

**1. Words are flexible.** English allows words to shift between functions freely. Understanding this prevents you from making errors like "That can't be an adjective because it's modifying a verb."

**2. Labels depend on context.** You cannot fully describe a word's grammar without seeing it in a sentence. The word *walk* is a verb in "I walk to school" but a noun in "The walk was pleasant."

**3. Complete analysis requires both.** Saying "*poor* is an adjective" in the sentence "The poor deserve help" is incomplete. A full analysis recognizes both what the word is (adjective) and what it's doing (functioning as a noun).

Throughout this chapter, we'll examine four major word classes. For each one, pay attention to both its defining characteristics (form) and the various roles it can play (function).

## 5.2 What Are Open Classes?

English words fall into two broad categories: **open classes** and **closed classes**. This chapter focuses on open classes; Chapter 6 addresses closed classes.

**Open classes** are word categories that readily accept new members. English speakers regularly create new nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs:

| Class | Recent Additions |
|-------|------------------|
| **Nouns** | *selfie*, *cryptocurrency*, *podcast*, *meme*, *influencer* |
| **Verbs** | *google*, *tweet*, *zoom*, *ghost* (meaning to ignore), *stream* |
| **Adjectives** | *viral*, *sustainable*, *gluten-free*, *binge-worthy* |
| **Adverbs** | *literally* (emphatic), *lowkey*, *ironically* (new usage) |

These four classes—nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs—contain the vast majority of English words and carry most of the content meaning in sentences. They are sometimes called **content words** or **lexical words**.

### Why Does It Matter That Classes Are "Open"?

The openness of these classes tells us something profound about language: it's creative. We don't memorize a fixed list of nouns and then stop—we keep making new ones. When Bitcoin emerged, English speakers immediately needed a word, and *cryptocurrency* was coined. When a new social platform appeared, *tweet* became both a noun and a verb.

This creativity follows rules. We don't randomly string sounds together; we use the morphological patterns from Chapter 4. A new noun meaning "one who podcasts" naturally becomes *podcaster*, following the same pattern that gave us *teacher* and *writer* centuries ago.

Understanding open classes helps you:
1. **Identify parts of speech reliably** using formal tests rather than meaning
2. **Analyze phrase structure** by recognizing what can serve as a phrase's head
3. **See language change in action** as new words enter primarily through open classes

Each open class has characteristic **morphological** properties (what endings the word can take) and **syntactic** properties (how the word behaves in sentences). The following sections examine each class in detail, providing tests you can use to identify membership and explaining how each class builds phrases.

---

## 5.3 Nouns

**Nouns** are often described as words that name people, places, things, or ideas. This semantic definition works much of the time—*teacher*, *Paris*, *table*, and *freedom* are all nouns. But meaning can mislead us. Is *destruction* a "thing"? What about *arrival* or *swimming*? These are nouns too, but they seem to name actions rather than objects.

The reliable way to identify nouns is through their grammatical behavior—specifically, through tests that reveal their morphological and syntactic properties.

### Morphological Tests for Nouns

Morphological tests examine what forms a word can take. Nouns have distinctive morphological properties that set them apart from other word classes.

**Test 1: Plural formation**

Nouns can typically be made plural. This is perhaps the most reliable morphological test for nouns:
- *book* → *books*
- *child* → *children*
- *analysis* → *analyses*
- *happiness* → *happinesses* (rare but grammatical)

If you can pluralize a word, it's almost certainly a noun. Note that some nouns resist pluralization (mass nouns like *water*, *information*), but the fact that we can even ask the question "Can this be plural?" suggests noun-hood.

**Test 2: Possessive marking**

Nouns can take the possessive marker *'s*:
- *the dog's tail*
- *Maria's book*
- *the committee's decision*

Other word classes cannot take this marker: we don't say *~~the happy's effect~~* or *~~the quickly's result~~*.

**Test 3: Noun-forming suffixes**

If a word ends in certain suffixes, it's likely a noun. These suffixes convert other word classes into nouns:

| Suffix | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| *-tion/-sion* | *action*, *decision*, *conclusion* |
| *-ness* | *happiness*, *awkwardness*, *cleverness* |
| *-ity* | *curiosity*, *generosity*, *ambiguity* |
| *-ment* | *government*, *amazement*, *establishment* |
| *-er/-or* | *teacher*, *actor*, *writer* |

When you see these endings, think "noun."

### Syntactic Tests for Nouns

Syntactic tests examine how a word behaves in sentences. Where can the word appear? What other words can accompany it?

**Test 1: The determiner test**

Nouns can follow words like *a*, *the*, *this*, *my*, and *every*. These words (called determiners) specifically introduce nouns:
- *the **proposal***
- *a **happiness***
- *every **decision***

This test is powerful because determiners exclusively precede nouns. If *the* or *a* can go in front of a word, that word is functioning as a noun.

**Test 2: The adjective modification test**

Nouns can be modified by adjectives—words that describe qualities:
- *the **new** proposal*
- *a **great** happiness*
- *every **important** decision*

Adjectives slot in between the determiner and the noun. If a word can appear in the position after an adjective, it's behaving as a noun.

**Test 3: The pronoun replacement test**

A noun (along with its modifiers) can be replaced by a pronoun like *it*, *they*, or *she*:
- *The new proposal* → *It*
- *My older brother* → *He*
- *Those expensive books* → *They*

This test helps identify noun phrases—groups of words built around a noun.

**Test 4: The subject/object position test**

Nouns naturally fill the subject and object slots in sentences:
- Subject: ***Books** are expensive.*
- Direct object: *I bought **books**.*
- Object of preposition: *I learned from **books**.*

### Subclasses of Nouns

Not all nouns behave identically. Two important distinctions affect how nouns can be used.

**Common vs. Proper Nouns**

- **Common nouns** name general categories: *city*, *teacher*, *book*
- **Proper nouns** name specific, unique entities: *Chicago*, *Professor Smith*, *Friday*

Proper nouns are capitalized and often don't take determiners: *Chicago is large* (not *~~The Chicago~~*). When a proper noun does take a determiner, it often signals a different meaning: *the Amazon* (river) vs. *Amazon* (company).

**Count vs. Mass Nouns**

- **Count nouns** refer to discrete, countable entities: *book/books*, *idea/ideas*
  - Can be pluralized: *three books*
  - Take *a/an*: *a book*
  - Take number words: *several ideas*

- **Mass nouns** refer to undifferentiated substances or concepts: *water*, *information*, *furniture*
  - Cannot be pluralized: *~~informations~~*, *~~furnitures~~*
  - Cannot take *a/an*: *~~a furniture~~*
  - Take quantity words instead: *some water*, *much information*

### Noun Phrases: Structure and Headship

Nouns don't typically appear alone. They form the center of **noun phrases (NP)**—groups of words built around a noun. The noun is the **head** of the phrase, meaning it's the essential, obligatory element that determines what kind of phrase it is.

Think of the head as the word you cannot remove. In the phrase *the old brown dog in the yard*, you can remove *old*, *brown*, *in the yard*, and even *the*—and still have a grammatical noun phrase (*dog*). But remove *dog*, and you have nothing functional left.

**A noun phrase has this basic structure:**

```
                NP
        ┌───────┼────────┐
       Det     Adj       N
        │       │        │
       the    tall     student
```

Larger noun phrases add more modifiers before and after the head:

```
                    NP
    ┌───────┬───────┼───────────┐
   Det     Adj     Adj          N        PP
    │       │       │           │     ┌──┴──┐
   the   brilliant young     student  from Ohio
```

**Pre-modifiers** appear before the head noun:
- Determiners: *the*, *a*, *my*, *this*
- Adjectives: *tall*, *beautiful*, *old*
- Other nouns: *coffee* (in *coffee table*)

**Post-modifiers** appear after the head noun:
- Phrases starting with words like *in*, *of*, *from*: *the man **in the hat***
- Clauses starting with *that*, *who*, *which*: *the book **that I read***
- Participial phrases: *the dog **running in the park***

When identifying the head, ask: "Which word could stand alone and still make sense as a noun phrase?" That's your head.

---

## 5.4 Verbs

**Verbs** are the engine of the sentence. While nouns name things, verbs make things happen—or describe states of being. Every complete sentence requires a verb, and the verb determines much of the sentence's structure: how many participants are needed, what time frame is being discussed, whether the action is complete or ongoing.

Semantically, verbs express actions (*run*, *build*, *think*), states (*know*, *believe*, *own*), or occurrences (*happen*, *become*, *appear*). But as with nouns, we identify verbs more reliably through grammatical tests.

### Morphological Tests for Verbs

Verbs in English have a distinctive set of forms—more than any other word class. If a word can take these various forms, it's a verb.

**Test 1: Past tense formation**

Verbs can be marked for past tense:
- *walk* → *walked*
- *see* → *saw*
- *go* → *went*

This is perhaps the most diagnostic test. If you can put a word into past tense, it's a verb: "Yesterday, I ___ed" (or an irregular past form).

**Test 2: Third-person singular present**

Verbs take *-s* when the subject is third-person singular (*he*, *she*, *it*):
- *I walk* → *she walks*
- *I see* → *he sees*

This is the only agreement marking English verbs still carry, but it's a reliable indicator of verb-hood.

**Test 3: Progressive form (-ing)**

Verbs can take the *-ing* suffix to form the progressive:
- *walk* → *walking*
- *see* → *seeing*

Every verb in English can take *-ing*. If you can add *-ing* to a word and use it after *be* ("She is ___ing"), it's a verb.

**Test 4: Participial forms**

Verbs have a past participle form (used with *have* and in passives):
- *walk* → *walked* (regular)
- *see* → *seen* (irregular)
- *go* → *gone* (irregular)

### Syntactic Tests for Verbs

**Test 1: The modal test**

Verbs can follow modal words like *can*, *will*, *might*, *should*, *must*:
- *can walk*
- *will see*
- *might go*

If a word can slot into "She can ___," it's a verb.

**Test 2: The infinitive test**

Verbs can follow *to*:
- *to walk*
- *to see*
- *to understand*

The "to ___" construction (called the infinitive) is available only to verbs.

**Test 3: The negation test**

Verbs can be negated, typically using *do* + *not*:
- *She does not walk.*
- *I did not see it.*

### Verb Forms: The Principal Parts

Every English verb has five forms, traditionally called the **principal parts**:

| Form | Regular (*walk*) | Irregular (*see*) | Irregular (*go*) |
|------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Base | walk | see | go |
| Past | walked | saw | went |
| Past participle | walked | seen | gone |
| Present participle | walking | seeing | going |
| 3rd person singular | walks | sees | goes |

**Regular verbs** (the vast majority) form their past tense and past participle by adding *-ed*.

**Irregular verbs** form these parts unpredictably—you must memorize them. Common irregular verbs include *be*, *have*, *go*, *see*, *take*, *make*, *come*, *know*.

### Verb Phrases: Structure and Headship

Like nouns, verbs form phrases. A **verb phrase (VP)** is built around a verb as its head. The verb phrase includes the main verb plus any complements the verb requires.

What makes verb phrases interesting is that different verbs require different complements:

```
        VP                         VP                           VP
        │                     ┌────┴────┐               ┌───────┼───────┐
        V                     V         NP              V       NP       NP
        │                     │         │               │       │        │
     slept                  read    the book          gave     her    a present
  (no complement)      (requires object)         (requires two objects)
```

The verb determines what must follow—this is the verb's **valency**, which Chapter 8 explores in detail. For now, notice that:

- *sleep* doesn't require anything after it (intransitive)
- *read* requires something to be read (transitive)
- *give* requires both a recipient and a thing given (ditransitive)

This property—that verbs dictate sentence structure—makes the verb the most important word in most sentences.

---

## 5.5 Adjectives

**Adjectives** are the descriptors of language. They modify nouns, telling us what kind of thing something is, what quality it has, or which one we mean. A *tall* building, a *happy* child, an *interesting* problem—in each case, the adjective narrows down the noun, adding specificity.

Unlike nouns and verbs, which often carry the core meaning of a sentence, adjectives enrich and qualify. They answer questions like "What kind?" (*a **wooden** table*), "Which one?" (*the **third** attempt*), and "What is it like?" (*She seems **nervous**.*).

### Morphological Tests for Adjectives

**Test 1: Comparative and superlative forms**

Most adjectives can be graded—that is, they can express degrees of a quality:
- *tall* → *taller* → *tallest*
- *happy* → *happier* → *happiest*
- *beautiful* → *more beautiful* → *most beautiful*

If a word can become comparative or superlative, it's almost certainly an adjective. This test distinguishes adjectives from nouns and verbs, which cannot be graded this way (we don't say *~~taller book~~* meaning "more of a book" or *~~he walked the walkedest~~*).

**Test 2: The *-ish* test**

Many adjectives accept the suffix *-ish*, meaning "somewhat":
- *tall* → *tallish*
- *red* → *reddish*
- *young* → *youngish*

This is a quick informal test. If *-ish* sounds natural, you likely have an adjective.

**Test 3: Adverb formation with *-ly***

Many adjectives can become adverbs by adding *-ly*:
- *happy* → *happily*
- *quick* → *quickly*
- *careful* → *carefully*

This shows the close relationship between adjectives and adverbs—and also helps identify adjectives in the first place.

### Syntactic Tests for Adjectives

**Test 1: The attributive position test**

Adjectives can appear between a determiner and a noun—this position, directly before the noun, is called **attributive** position:
- *the **tall** man*
- *a **happy** child*
- *the **interesting** book*

This is a defining characteristic. If a word can slot into "the ___ noun," it's behaving as an adjective.

**Test 2: The predicative position test**

Adjectives can follow linking verbs like *be*, *seem*, *become*, and *appear*—this position, after the verb, is called **predicative** position:
- *The man is **tall**.*
- *She seems **happy**.*
- *The book appears **interesting**.*

Most adjectives work in both positions. A few work in only one (see below).

**Test 3: The *very* test**

Adjectives can be modified by degree words like *very*, *extremely*, and *quite*:
- ***very** tall*
- ***extremely** happy*
- ***quite** interesting*

If *very* sounds natural before a word, that word is likely an adjective. (Nouns and verbs don't accept *very*: *~~very book~~*, *~~very walked~~*.)

### Special Classes of Adjectives

Most adjectives are **gradable**—they can express degrees (*taller*, *very tall*). But some adjectives express absolute properties and resist grading:

- *dead* — something is dead or not; *~~very dead~~* sounds odd
- *unique* — traditionally, something is unique or not; *~~more unique~~* is contested
- *pregnant* — grammatically ungradable, though metaphor sometimes changes this

Some adjectives are **attributive-only** (they can only appear before nouns):
- *the **main** reason* ✓ / *~~The reason is main~~* ✗
- *a **mere** child* ✓ / *~~The child is mere~~* ✗

Others are **predicative-only** (they can only appear after linking verbs):
- *The child is **asleep*** ✓ / *~~the asleep child~~* ✗
- *She felt **afraid*** ✓ / *~~the afraid woman~~* ✗

### Adjective Phrases: Structure and Headship

Adjectives form phrases just as nouns and verbs do. An **adjective phrase (AdjP)** has an adjective as its head, with optional modifiers before and after:

```
      AdjP                    AdjP                        AdjP
       │              ┌───────┴───────┐           ┌────────┼────────┐
      Adj            Adv             Adj         Adv      Adj        PP
       │              │               │           │        │      ┌──┴──┐
     happy          very           happy       very     proud   of her work
```

Pre-modifiers of adjectives are typically degree adverbs: *very*, *extremely*, *somewhat*, *quite*.

Post-modifiers are often phrases introduced by prepositions: *proud **of her work***, *afraid **of the dark***, *interested **in linguistics***.

**Where adjective phrases function:**

- **Attributive** (modifying a noun): *the [very tall] man*
- **Predicative** (after linking verb): *The man is [very tall].*

When an adjective phrase appears attributively, it usually precedes the noun. When it appears predicatively, it follows the linking verb and describes the subject.

---

## 5.6 Adverbs

**Adverbs** are the most versatile and varied word class in English. While nouns name, verbs act, and adjectives describe nouns, adverbs do a bit of everything: they can modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, and even entire sentences. This versatility makes them both useful and tricky to identify.

The traditional definition—"adverbs modify verbs"—captures only part of the picture. Consider these sentences:

- *She spoke **quietly**.* (modifies verb)
- *She is **extremely** talented.* (modifies adjective)
- *She works **very** hard.* (modifies adverb)
- ***Unfortunately**, she couldn't attend.* (modifies entire sentence)

In all four cases, the bolded word is an adverb—but each is doing different work.

### Morphological Tests for Adverbs

**Test 1: The *-ly* suffix**

Many adverbs are formed by adding *-ly* to adjectives:
- *quick* → *quickly*
- *happy* → *happily*
- *careful* → *carefully*

This is a reliable pattern: if you see *-ly* on what looks like an adjective, you probably have an adverb. But be careful—some *-ly* words are adjectives (*friendly*, *lovely*, *costly*), and many common adverbs don't end in *-ly* at all (*fast*, *well*, *always*, *never*, *here*, *there*).

**Test 2: Comparative/superlative forms**

Some adverbs can be graded, just like adjectives:
- *fast* → *faster* → *fastest*
- *soon* → *sooner* → *soonest*
- *quickly* → *more quickly* → *most quickly*

But many common adverbs cannot: *~~very-er~~*, *~~always-est~~*, *~~therefore-er~~*. For these, we must rely on syntactic tests.

### Syntactic Tests for Adverbs

**Test 1: Modifying verbs**

This is the classic adverb function. Adverbs appear near verbs and describe how, when, where, or how often the action occurs:
- *She spoke **quietly**.* (how)
- *He **always** arrives late.* (frequency)
- *They **suddenly** disappeared.* (manner/time)

**Test 2: Modifying adjectives**

Adverbs, especially degree adverbs, can intensify or qualify adjectives:
- *a **very** tall building*
- *an **extremely** difficult problem*
- ***surprisingly** easy*

This is how *very*, *quite*, *extremely*, and *rather* typically function.

**Test 3: Modifying other adverbs**

Adverbs can stack, with one adverb modifying another:
- *She spoke **very** quietly.*
- *He runs **quite** fast.*
- *It happened **rather** suddenly.*

**Test 4: Modifying sentences**

Some adverbs can modify an entire sentence, typically appearing at the beginning and expressing the speaker's attitude:
- ***Unfortunately**, I can't attend.*
- ***Clearly**, we have a problem.*
- ***Apparently**, they've left.*

These are called **sentence adverbs** or **commenting adverbs**.

**Test 5: The attributive position test (negative)**

Here's a crucial way to distinguish adverbs from adjectives: adverbs **cannot** appear in attributive position (between a determiner and a noun):
- *the tall man* ✓ (*tall* is an adjective)
- *~~the quickly man~~* ✗ (*quickly* is an adverb)
- *~~the often problem~~* ✗ (*often* is an adverb)

If a word **can** appear in "the ___ noun" position, it's an adjective. If it **cannot**, it might be an adverb.

### Semantic Categories of Adverbs

Adverbs are often classified by what question they answer:

| Type | Examples | Question Answered |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Manner** | *quickly*, *carefully*, *well* | How? |
| **Time** | *yesterday*, *soon*, *already* | When? |
| **Place** | *here*, *there*, *everywhere* | Where? |
| **Frequency** | *often*, *rarely*, *sometimes*, *always* | How often? |
| **Degree** | *very*, *extremely*, *somewhat* | To what extent? |
| **Sentence/Comment** | *unfortunately*, *clearly*, *obviously* | Speaker's attitude? |

### Adverb Phrases: Structure and Headship

Adverbs form phrases, though adverb phrases tend to be simpler than noun or verb phrases. An **adverb phrase (AdvP)** has an adverb as its head, often with another adverb modifying it:

```
      AdvP                   AdvP
       │              ┌───────┴───────┐
      Adv            Adv             Adv
       │              │               │
    quickly         very          quickly
```

Adverb phrases can grow by stacking degree modifiers:
- *quickly*
- *very quickly*
- *rather too quickly*

**Where adverb phrases function:**

- Modifying verbs: *She spoke [very quietly].*
- Modifying adjectives: *She is [extremely] talented.*
- Modifying adverbs: *She works [very] hard.*
- Modifying sentences: *[Unfortunately], she left.*

## 5.7 Summary: Identifying Open-Class Words

This chapter has covered a lot of ground. Here's a quick reference to help you identify word classes and apply the dual-identification principle.

### The Dual-Identification Principle

Always ask both questions:
1. **What IS this word?** (form—its part of speech)
2. **What is this word DOING?** (function—its role in this sentence)

### Quick Reference Tests

| Part of Speech | Key Morphological Tests | Key Syntactic Tests |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Noun** | Plural (*-s*), possessive (*'s*), noun suffixes (*-tion*, *-ness*) | Follows *the/a*, takes adjective modifier, can be replaced by pronoun |
| **Verb** | Past tense (*-ed*), 3rd singular (*-s*), *-ing* form | Follows *can/will/might*, follows *to*, can be negated |
| **Adjective** | Comparative/superlative (*-er/-est*), *-ish*, forms adverb with *-ly* | Between *the* and noun, after *be/seem*, modified by *very* |
| **Adverb** | Often *-ly*, some comparatives | Modifies verbs/adjectives/adverbs/sentences, cannot go between *the* and noun |

### Phrase Types

Each word class has an associated phrase type with the word as its **head**:

| Phrase | Head | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Noun phrase (NP) | Noun | *the tall student from Ohio* |
| Verb phrase (VP) | Verb | *read the book carefully* |
| Adjective phrase (AdjP) | Adjective | *very proud of her work* |
| Adverb phrase (AdvP) | Adverb | *very quickly* |

### Analysis Process

1. **Identify form**: What part of speech is this word typically? Apply morphological and syntactic tests.
2. **Identify function**: What role is it playing in this sentence? Is it modifying something? Acting as subject or object?
3. **Note mismatches**: If form and function differ, identify both. (*The poor* = adjective form, nominal function)

## Homework: Open Classes

### Part 1: Word Class Identification (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each underlined word, identify its part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) using at least one morphological or syntactic test from the chapter. State which test you used.

#### Example (completed):

**Word:** *carefully* in "She **carefully** reviewed the document."

Part of speech: Adverb

Test used: The -ly suffix test. "Carefully" is formed by adding -ly to the adjective "careful," which is a reliable pattern for adverbs. Additionally, it modifies the verb "reviewed," telling us how she reviewed.

### Part 2: Form vs. Function Analysis (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each sentence, identify the form (part of speech) and the function (grammatical role) of the underlined word. Remember the dual-identification principle: form is what the word IS; function is what the word DOES.

#### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *The **rich** often have different concerns.*

Word: *rich*

Form: Adjective (it can be graded: richer, richest; it can be modified by "very": very rich)

Function: Nominal (functioning as a noun—it follows the determiner "the," serves as the subject of the sentence, and refers to a group of people)

### Part 3: Phrase Construction (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each head word provided, build a phrase of the specified type. Include at least two modifiers (pre-modifiers, post-modifiers, or both).

#### Example (completed):

**Head:** *teacher* (build a noun phrase)

Noun phrase: *the experienced history teacher from the local high school*

Components: Det (the) + Adj (experienced) + N modifier (history) + Head N (teacher) + PP (from the local high school)

**11.** Head: *decision* (build a noun phrase)

Noun phrase:

Components:

**12.** Head: *proud* (build an adjective phrase)

Adjective phrase:

Components:

**13.** Head: *quickly* (build an adverb phrase)

Adverb phrase:

Components:

### Part 4: Sentence Writing (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Write original sentences following each prompt. Underline the requested element.

---

**14.** Write a sentence using a noun formed with the suffix *-ment*:

**15.** Write a sentence using an adjective in predicative position (after a linking verb like *be*, *seem*, or *become*):

**16.** Write a sentence where an adverb modifies an adjective (not a verb):

**17.** Write a sentence where a noun functions adjectivally (modifying another noun):

---

### Part 5: Analysis and Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow.

#### Passage:

*The elderly deserve our respect and consideration. A daily exercise routine significantly improves overall health. The government's new environmental policy cautiously addresses industrial pollution concerns.*

---

**18.** Find two examples in the passage where form and function differ. For each, identify the word, state its form (part of speech), and explain its function in that sentence.

Example 1:

Word:
Form:
Function:
Explanation:

Example 2:

Word:
Form:
Function:
Explanation:

---

**19.** Identify the head and all modifiers in the following noun phrase from the passage:

*the government's new environmental policy*

Head:

Pre-modifiers (list each and identify its type—determiner, adjective, noun, etc.):

---

**20.** In 3-4 sentences, explain why understanding the distinction between form and function is important for grammatical analysis. Use a specific example from the passage or create your own to illustrate your point.

---

*Total estimated time: 30-40 minutes*

## Chapter Summary

- The **form vs. function** distinction is fundamental: **form** is what a word IS (its part of speech), while **function** is what a word DOES (its role in a sentence).
- The **dual-identification principle**: when analyzing grammar, always identify both form and function.
- **Open classes** (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) freely accept new members and carry content meaning.
- Each open class has distinctive **morphological** properties (word forms) and **syntactic** properties (sentence behavior).
- **Nouns** can be pluralized, possess, follow determiners, and serve as subjects/objects.
- **Verbs** can be inflected for tense, follow modals, and dictate sentence structure.
- **Adjectives** can be graded, appear between determiners and nouns (attributive), and follow linking verbs (predicative).
- **Adverbs** often end in *-ly*, modify verbs/adjectives/adverbs/sentences, and cannot appear between determiners and nouns.
- Each word class forms **phrases** with the word as **head**: noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), adjective phrases (AdjP), adverb phrases (AdvP).

## Glossary

**Adjective**: An open-class word that typically modifies nouns and can be graded (comparative/superlative).

**Adjective phrase (AdjP)**: A phrase built around an adjective head, often with degree modifiers.

**Adverb**: An open-class word that modifies verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or sentences.

**Adverb phrase (AdvP)**: A phrase built around an adverb head.

**Attributive position**: The position directly before a noun, where adjectives typically appear (*the tall man*).

**Dual-identification principle**: The practice of identifying both a word's form (part of speech) and its function (role in the sentence) when analyzing grammar.

**Form**: A word's inherent grammatical category based on its morphology and typical behavior.

**Function**: The grammatical role a word or phrase plays in a particular sentence.

**Head**: The central, obligatory element of a phrase that determines its category.

**Modifier**: An optional element that adds information about the head.

**Morphological test**: A test based on the forms a word can take (plural, tense, etc.).

**Noun**: An open-class word that can be pluralized, possess, and follow determiners.

**Noun phrase (NP)**: A phrase built around a noun head, with optional determiners and modifiers.

**Open class**: A word category that freely accepts new members (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs).

**Predicative position**: The position after a linking verb, where adjectives describe the subject (*The man is tall*).

**Syntactic test**: A test based on how a word behaves in sentences.

**Verb**: An open-class word that can be inflected for tense and determines the structure of the sentence.

**Verb phrase (VP)**: A phrase built around a verb head, containing the verb and any required complements.
