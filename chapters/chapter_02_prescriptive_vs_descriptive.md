## 2.1 Two Approaches to Grammar

In the previous chapter, we introduced the distinction between descriptive and prescriptive approaches to grammar. This distinction is so fundamental to the study of language that it deserves a chapter of its own. Understanding the difference between these two approaches will help you think more clearly about language, evaluate grammatical advice more critically, and make better choices in your own writing.

### Descriptive Grammar: How Language Actually Works

**Descriptive grammar** aims to describe language as it is actually used by speakers. Descriptive linguists observe, document, and analyze the patterns that speakers produce—without making judgments about whether those patterns are "correct" or "incorrect." The goal is to understand the mental rules that speakers have internalized, rules that allow them to produce and understand sentences they've never heard before.

Descriptive rules are patterns that native speakers follow unconsciously. You don't need to be taught these rules; you acquire them naturally by being exposed to language. By the time you started school, you had already mastered thousands of descriptive rules—rules so deeply ingrained that you couldn't violate them if you tried.

**Examples of descriptive rules:**

1. **Word order determines meaning.** In English, "The dog bit the man" means something entirely different from "The man bit the dog." No one teaches children this rule explicitly; they figure it out from exposure. And no native speaker ever gets it wrong.

2. **Adjectives precede nouns (in most cases).** We say "the red house," not "the house red." We say "a beautiful sunset," not "a sunset beautiful." This pattern is so automatic that native speakers don't even realize they're following a rule.

3. **Question formation requires auxiliary movement.** To turn "She can swim" into a question, we move "can" to the front: "Can she swim?" If there's no auxiliary, we add "do": "She swims" becomes "Does she swim?" Native speakers produce these patterns effortlessly, even though few could articulate the rule.

The key characteristic of descriptive rules is that violating them produces gibberish—sequences that aren't recognizable as English at all. "Store the to went him and me" isn't a sentence any English speaker would produce or understand. It violates the descriptive rules of English word order.

### Prescriptive Grammar: How Someone Says Language Should Be Used

**Prescriptive grammar** sets forth rules about how language *should* be used. These rules are explicitly taught—in schools, in style guides, in writing handbooks—and they represent the preferences of particular groups or authorities. Prescriptive rules are typically framed as "should" or "should not" statements: "Don't end a sentence with a preposition." "Never split an infinitive." "Use 'whom,' not 'who,' as an object."

Unlike descriptive rules, prescriptive rules must be consciously learned. You weren't born knowing that split infinitives are supposedly wrong; someone had to tell you. And unlike descriptive rules, violating prescriptive rules produces comprehensible English—English that might be judged negatively in certain contexts, but English nonetheless.

**Examples of prescriptive rules:**

1. **Don't end a sentence with a preposition.** According to this rule, "What are you looking at?" should be "At what are you looking?" But the first version is natural English that everyone understands; the second sounds stilted and awkward.

2. **Use "whom" as the object of a verb or preposition.** According to this rule, "Who did you see?" should be "Whom did you see?" But in casual speech, most English speakers use "who" in both positions without confusion.

3. **Avoid double negatives.** According to this rule, "I don't know nothing" is incorrect because two negatives make a positive. But speakers who use double negatives intend emphasis, not logical confusion—and everyone understands them perfectly.

### A Quick Test

Here's a useful way to distinguish the two types of rules: if a rule can be violated while still producing comprehensible English, it's probably prescriptive. If violating the rule produces gibberish, it's descriptive.

Compare:
- "Me and him went to the store" (violates prescriptive rule but perfectly comprehensible)
- "Store the to went him and me" (violates descriptive word-order rules and is incomprehensible)

The first sentence might earn you a correction from your English teacher, but no one would fail to understand it. The second sentence isn't English at all—it violates the fundamental patterns that make English English.

### Why the Distinction Matters

Understanding this distinction matters because many people confuse the two types of rules. They treat prescriptive preferences as if they were descriptive facts—as if ending a sentence with a preposition somehow violated the nature of English rather than the preferences of certain authorities.

This confusion has real consequences. Students are told their language is "wrong" when it's actually just different from what a style guide prefers. Speakers of non-standard dialects are judged as unintelligent when they're following perfectly systematic rules—just not the prestige variety's rules. And writers become anxious about "mistakes" that aren't mistakes at all, just choices that particular authorities happen to disprefer.

## 2.2 Prescriptive Rules

Prescriptive rules are typically formulated as "should" or "should not" statements: "Don't end a sentence with a preposition." "Never split an infinitive." "Use 'whom,' not 'who,' as an object." These rules are taught explicitly—in schools, in style guides, in writing handbooks—and many people believe they represent timeless standards of good English.

In fact, most prescriptive rules have specific historical origins, and their status as "rules" often reflects social and political factors more than linguistic ones.

### The Origins of Prescriptive Grammar in English

The tradition of prescriptive grammar in English emerged in the eighteenth century, a period when many educated people believed that English needed to be refined, regulated, and fixed. Writers and scholars worried that English was changing too quickly, that it lacked the regularity and precision of Latin, and that it needed authoritative guidance.

Several factors drove this anxiety:
- England was becoming a major colonial and commercial power, and its elites wanted a "proper" language to match their status
- The rise of printing and literacy created demand for standardized written forms
- Latin remained the prestige language of scholarship, and English seemed irregular and vernacular by comparison
- Social mobility meant that people could no longer rely on family background to signal status—language became a marker of education and refinement

Into this environment came the grammarians.

### The Great Grammarians

**Robert Lowth** (1710–1787), a bishop and Oxford professor, published *A Short Introduction to English Grammar* (Lowth, 1762). Lowth's grammar was immensely influential, establishing many of the prescriptive rules still taught today. He declared that ending sentences with prepositions was "an idiom which our language is strongly inclined to" but which should be avoided in formal writing. He criticized double negatives as illogical (even though they had been standard in English for centuries, including in Chaucer and Shakespeare). He insisted on *whom* as the objective case, even in contexts where *who* was more natural.

**Lindley Murray** (1745–1826), an American-born grammarian, published *English Grammar* (Murray, 1795), which became the most widely used grammar textbook for the next century. Murray borrowed heavily from Lowth but was even more dogmatic. His grammar went through over 200 editions and shaped generations of English speakers' beliefs about "correct" grammar.

What's striking about these grammarians is that they often based their rules not on how English actually worked, but on how they thought it *should* work—often by analogy to Latin.

### Latin as the Model

Many prescriptive rules were borrowed from Latin grammar, despite fundamental differences between the two languages.

**The split infinitive rule**: Latin infinitives are single words (*amare* = "to love"), so they cannot be split. English infinitives are two words ("to love"), so they can be split ("to boldly go"). The prescriptive rule against splitting infinitives makes no sense for English—it was imported wholesale from Latin because Latin was considered the model of a proper language. Writers from Samuel Johnson to George Bernard Shaw to Gene Roddenberry have split infinitives with great effectiveness.

**The rule against ending sentences with prepositions**: Latin prepositions must precede their objects (*ad portam* = "to the gate"). But English has a long history of what linguists call "preposition stranding"—leaving the preposition at the end of a sentence ("What are you looking at?"). This construction is natural, idiomatic, and has been used by the best English writers for centuries. As Winston Churchill supposedly quipped about this rule, "This is the sort of English up with which I will not put."

**The rule against double negatives**: Latin uses single negation, so grammarians reasoned that English should too. They argued that two negatives make a positive ("I don't want nothing" supposedly means "I want something"). But this logic fails for language. Multiple negation for emphasis is found in many languages and was standard in English until the eighteenth century. "I can't get no satisfaction" is emphatic negation, not logical confusion—and every speaker of English understands it perfectly.

### Social and Political Functions

Prescriptive rules often serve as markers of social status and education. Knowing and following these rules signals membership in educated, privileged classes. Conversely, not following them can mark a speaker as uneducated or lower-class, regardless of their actual intelligence or capabilities.

This social function helps explain why prescriptive rules persist even when they don't reflect how most people actually speak. The rules become ways of distinguishing "us" from "them," of maintaining social boundaries. The people who make and enforce the rules are typically those who already hold social power, and the varieties they speak become the "standard" against which others are judged.

Consider who benefits from prescriptive rules:
- Children who grow up in families that speak the prestige variety arrive at school already "knowing the rules"
- Children who speak other varieties must learn a second system to be judged competent
- Test scores and "language proficiency" often measure conformity to prescriptive norms rather than communicative ability
- Professional advancement frequently depends on mastering prestige forms

This doesn't mean prescriptive rules are arbitrary or unimportant. Many of them promote clarity, precision, or ease of reading. The conventions of formal writing help create a common standard that readers can rely on. But it does mean that we should think critically about prescriptive rules—understanding their origins, recognizing their social functions, and evaluating whether they serve our purposes in a given situation.

### A Catalog of Prescriptive Rules

Let's examine some common prescriptive rules, their origins, and their status today:

**"Don't end a sentence with a preposition."**
This rule was borrowed from Latin and has never reflected actual English usage. Sentences like "Who did you talk to?" and "That's something I won't put up with" are perfectly natural and idiomatic. Straining to avoid final prepositions often produces awkward, stilted sentences. Most modern style guides acknowledge that this "rule" is outdated.

**"Don't start a sentence with 'and' or 'but'."**
Many teachers prohibit sentence-initial conjunctions, but the best writers have always used them. The King James Bible ("And God said, Let there be light: and there was light"), Jane Austen, Ernest Hemingway, and countless others begin sentences with conjunctions. They create emphasis, establish connections between ideas, and can make prose more vigorous. The prohibition may be useful for beginning writers who overuse this construction, but it's not a rule of English grammar.

**"Never split an infinitive."**
Borrowed from Latin (where infinitives can't be split because they're single words), this rule has been violated by excellent writers for centuries. Sometimes splitting the infinitive produces a better sentence: "to boldly go" has a rhythm that "to go boldly" or "boldly to go" lacks. Modern style guides generally advise against awkward splits but permit them when they improve clarity or flow.

**"Use the serial comma" (or don't).**
The serial comma (also called the Oxford comma) is the comma before "and" in a series: "I bought apples, oranges, and bananas." Some style guides require it; others prohibit it. This is purely a matter of convention—neither option is grammatically superior. Being consistent matters more than which option you choose. (Though partisans of the serial comma love to cite ambiguous sentences that can be resolved by its presence.)

**"Avoid the passive voice."**
Many writing guides advise against passive constructions ("The mouse was eaten by the cat") in favor of active ones ("The cat ate the mouse"). Active voice is often more direct and vigorous. But passive voice is useful when:
- The agent is unknown: "The window was broken during the storm."
- The agent is unimportant: "The building was constructed in 1890."
- You want to emphasize the action or patient: "The suspect was arrested."
- Scientific convention calls for it: "The data were analyzed using..."

Skilled writers use both voices strategically.

**"Use 'whom' as the object of a verb or preposition."**
In formal written English, "whom" is the objective form: "To whom did you speak?" "Whom did you see?" But in spoken English and informal writing, "who" has largely replaced "whom" in most contexts. Using "whom" incorrectly (hypercorrection) often sounds worse than using "who." Many linguists predict that "whom" will eventually disappear from English—it's already rare in casual speech.

**"Don't use singular 'they.'"**
Traditionally, "they" was considered exclusively plural, and singular indefinite reference required "he" (as in "Everyone should do his best"). But singular "they" has been used for centuries—Shakespeare wrote "And everyone to rest themselves betake" in *The Rape of Lucrece* (Shakespeare, 1594)—and has become standard in contemporary English for indefinite and nonbinary reference. Most style guides now accept it, and the American Dialect Society (2020) named singular "they" its Word of the Year in 2015 and Word of the Decade in 2020.

## 2.3 Descriptive Rules

Descriptive rules are the patterns that speakers naturally acquire as they learn their native language. These rules are not taught explicitly; children figure them out from the language they hear around them. By the time most children start school, they have already mastered thousands of these rules, even if they couldn't articulate a single one.

### Native Speaker Intuitions

One way linguists identify descriptive rules is by consulting native speaker intuitions. If you're a native English speaker, you know—without being taught—that "the big red balloon" sounds right while "the red big balloon" sounds odd. You know that "she walks" needs an *-s* but "they walk" doesn't. You know that "I saw her" is grammatical but "I saw she" isn't. These judgments reflect your unconscious knowledge of English grammar.

Descriptive rules are remarkably consistent across speakers of the same dialect. Ask a hundred native English speakers which sounds better, "The cat sat on the mat" or "The cat the mat on sat," and all hundred will choose the first. That consistency reflects shared grammatical knowledge.

These rules are also remarkably complex. Linguists have been studying English syntax for decades and still haven't fully described all the rules that native speakers know intuitively. Your knowledge of English is deeper and more sophisticated than any grammar book can capture.

### The Implicit Knowledge of Native Speakers

Consider what you know about English question formation. To turn a statement into a yes/no question, you move an auxiliary verb to the front:

- Statement: "She **can** speak French."
- Question: "**Can** she speak French?"

If there's no auxiliary, you add "do":

- Statement: "She speaks French."
- Question: "**Does** she speak French?"

But how do you know which word to move in complex sentences?

- Statement: "The man who **is** tall **can** speak French."
- Question: "**Can** the man who is tall speak French?" (correct)
- Not: "**Is** the man who tall can speak French?" (wrong)

You move the auxiliary from the main clause, not from the embedded relative clause. No one taught you this rule—you figured it out. And every native English speaker follows it perfectly, even though few could state the rule.

This is what linguists mean by "tacit" or "implicit" knowledge: rules you follow without conscious awareness.

### Word Order and Meaning

Some of the most fundamental descriptive rules involve word order. In English, word order determines grammatical relationships and meaning. "The dog bit the man" means something entirely different from "The man bit the dog," even though the two sentences contain exactly the same words. English relies heavily on word order because it has relatively few inflectional endings (unlike Latin or Russian, where endings mark grammatical relationships).

Other word order rules are equally systematic. Adjectives normally precede nouns ("the red house," not "the house red"—though French speakers say *la maison rouge*). When multiple adjectives appear, they occur in a specific order:

**Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose**

That's why "a beautiful big old rectangular green French silver whittling knife" sounds natural while other orders sound wrong. Native speakers follow this rule without ever being taught it or even knowing it exists. Try saying "a green rectangular old big beautiful knife"—it sounds bizarre.

This adjective-order rule is so deeply ingrained that most English speakers can't articulate it. When linguists discovered and described this pattern, many native speakers were astonished: "I've been following a rule I never knew existed!"

### Natural Acquisition

Children acquire descriptive rules through exposure to language, not through instruction. A child who hears "walked," "jumped," and "played" will eventually produce "goed" instead of "went"—evidence that they've extracted the rule for past tense formation and are applying it productively.

These "errors" are actually signs of sophisticated linguistic development. The child isn't making a mistake; they're demonstrating that they've learned the regular past-tense pattern and are generalizing it. Eventually, children learn that "go" is irregular, but the overgeneralization shows that they're not just mimicking what they hear—they're building a rule system.

Consider the acquisition sequence:
1. Child hears "went" and uses it correctly (memorized form)
2. Child discovers the *-ed* rule from other verbs
3. Child applies the rule to "go" and says "goed" (overgeneralization)
4. Child eventually learns that "go" is an exception
5. Child returns to "went" (but now understands it differently)

Stage 3, the "error" stage, is actually the most cognitively sophisticated—it shows the child has extracted and is applying an abstract rule.

### Descriptive Rules in Non-Standard Dialects

This natural acquisition process explains why descriptive rules are so consistent and so robust. They're built into the language-learning capacity of the human mind. Prescriptive rules, by contrast, must be consciously learned, and even highly educated speakers often fail to follow them in spontaneous speech.

Importantly, non-standard dialects have their own descriptive rules—patterns that are just as systematic as those of Standard English. African American Vernacular English (AAVE), for example, has grammatical rules for:

**Habitual "be"**: "She be working" means she works regularly (habitually), whereas "She working" means she's working right now. Standard English can't make this distinction with a single word.

**Negative concord**: "I don't want nothing" uses multiple negatives for emphasis, following a systematic rule (not random negativity).

**Copula deletion**: "She nice" follows a predictable pattern—the copula "is" can be deleted exactly where Standard English can contract it ("She's nice"), but not elsewhere.

These patterns aren't "broken" Standard English; they're rule-governed features of a different variety. Speakers of AAVE who use these forms are following their grammar, not failing to follow Standard grammar.

## 2.4 The Interplay of Both Approaches

Understanding the difference between prescriptive and descriptive grammar doesn't mean rejecting prescriptive rules. It means understanding what they are and when to apply them.

### When Prescriptive Rules Matter

Prescriptive rules matter in contexts where readers expect them. In academic writing, professional communication, and formal publications, following prescriptive conventions signals competence and credibility. Readers who expect formal prose may be distracted or annoyed by constructions that violate prescriptive norms, even if those constructions are grammatically fine in descriptive terms.

Think of it like dress codes. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with wearing jeans and a t-shirt, but if you show up to a job interview dressed that way, you might not get the job. The jeans aren't "wrong"—they're just not appropriate for the context. Similarly, starting a formal essay with "So" or using "they" as a singular pronoun in a conservative publication might be descriptively fine but prescriptively risky.

### When Prescriptive Rules Serve Clarity

Prescriptive rules also matter when clarity is at stake. Some prescriptive advice exists because following it genuinely reduces ambiguity or improves readability.

Consider pronoun reference. The prescriptive advice to keep pronouns close to their antecedents helps prevent confusion:

- Confusing: "The manager told the employee that she needed to improve her performance." (Who needs to improve—the manager or the employee?)
- Clearer: "The manager told the employee that the employee needed to improve."

Or consider modifier placement. "I only ate three cookies" might mean "I ate cookies, not cake" or "I ate three, not four." Careful placement of "only" can resolve ambiguity.

These aren't arbitrary preferences—they're tools for clear communication.

### Context-Dependent Choices

Effective communicators adjust their language to fit the context. The way you write an academic paper differs from the way you text a friend, which differs from the way you address a public meeting. None of these registers is inherently better than the others; they're appropriate for different purposes.

This means that apparent "violations" of prescriptive rules often aren't errors at all—they're choices. Starting a sentence with "but" might be perfect for a blog post but inappropriate for a legal brief. Using contractions might be ideal for a magazine article but wrong for a dissertation. Splitting an infinitive might create exactly the emphasis you want.

The goal is to make informed choices, not to follow rules blindly.

### A Framework for Decision-Making

When you encounter a prescriptive rule, ask yourself:

1. **What's the origin of this rule?** Is it based on Latin, on logic, on tradition, or on genuine clarity concerns?

2. **What's the context?** Am I writing for an audience that expects formal prose? Am I in a context where rule violations will be judged harshly?

3. **What's the alternative?** If I follow the rule, does the sentence become clearer, or just different? Does violating the rule create ambiguity?

4. **What's my purpose?** Am I trying to sound authoritative and formal, or conversational and accessible?

5. **What do expert writers do?** Not just textbooks, but actual good writers—novelists, journalists, essayists. Do they follow this rule?

A descriptive understanding of grammar enables better prescriptive choices. When you know how English actually works, you can evaluate prescriptive advice more intelligently. You can recognize when a "rule" is really just a preference, when it's outdated, or when it genuinely promotes clarity. You can follow conventions when they serve your purposes and bend them when they don't.

### The Informed Writer

Consider the "rule" against split infinitives. If you know that this rule has no basis in English grammar and has been broken by good writers for centuries, you can split infinitives when doing so sounds better: "to boldly go" has a rhythm that "to go boldly" lacks. But if you're writing for an audience that includes sticklers who will be distracted by the split infinitive, you might decide to avoid it—not because it's wrong, but because it could undermine your message.

This is what it means to study grammar as a writer, not just as a rule-follower: understanding the resources the language offers so you can deploy them effectively for your own purposes.

The difference between a novice writer and an expert isn't that the expert follows more rules—it's that the expert knows which rules to follow, when to follow them, and when breaking them serves the writing better.

## 2.5 How We Learn Language: First and Second Language Acquisition

Understanding the difference between descriptive and prescriptive grammar helps clarify how people acquire language. The process differs dramatically depending on whether you're learning your first language or a subsequent one.

### First Language Acquisition: Effortless and Complete

Your **first language (L1)** is the language you acquired from the people around you in early childhood. (Many people have more than one first language—children raised in bilingual households often acquire both languages simultaneously.) First language acquisition is one of the most remarkable accomplishments of human cognition.

Children acquire language on a remarkably consistent timeline:

- **0-12 months**: Babies tune into the sounds of their language and begin to understand words.
- **12-18 months**: First words emerge. Vocabulary grows slowly—perhaps 50 words by 18 months.
- **18-24 months**: The "vocabulary explosion"—children rapidly learn new words. Two-word combinations appear.
- **2-3 years**: Grammar emerges. Children begin using word endings and constructing longer sentences.
- **3-5 years**: Complex sentences appear. Most of the core grammar is in place by age 5.

What's remarkable about this process is how little explicit teaching it requires. Children acquire the **descriptive grammar** of their community—the actual patterns used by the speakers around them—simply through exposure. No one sits a three-year-old down and explains subject-verb agreement or question formation. Children figure these patterns out on their own.

This is why first language acquisition almost always succeeds. Barring severe impairment, every child who is exposed to language acquires a fully grammatical first language. The grammar they acquire is the descriptive grammar of their community—if a child grows up in a community that uses double negatives, that becomes part of the child's grammar, just as "I don't have any" becomes part of another child's grammar. Both children have successfully acquired language.

### Second Language Acquisition: Effort Required

A **second language (L2)** is any language learned after the first language is established. L2 acquisition works differently from L1 acquisition in important ways.

**L2 acquisition is more variable.** While every child successfully acquires their first language, adult learners rarely achieve native-like proficiency in a second language. Success depends on factors like motivation, instruction, immersion, and aptitude.

**L2 acquisition typically requires explicit instruction.** While children acquire descriptive rules unconsciously, adult learners often benefit from being taught rules explicitly—both descriptive patterns ("English puts adjectives before nouns") and prescriptive conventions ("In formal writing, avoid contractions").

**L2 acquisition happens after the first language is in place.** Adult learners approach a new language through the lens of their first language. Features that differ from L1 tend to be harder to acquire; features similar to L1 are easier.

These differences have led some linguists to propose a **critical period** for language acquisition—a window in early childhood during which the brain is especially receptive to language learning. After this window closes (perhaps around puberty), language learning becomes more difficult and less complete.

### Implications for Understanding Grammar

This distinction between L1 and L2 acquisition helps explain why prescriptive rules are so often necessary in education. Children who grow up speaking a prestige variety arrive at school already having acquired its descriptive patterns unconsciously. Children who grow up speaking other varieties are essentially learning Standard English as a second dialect—they need explicit instruction in patterns that differ from their home variety.

Similarly, students learning English as a second language need explicit instruction in both descriptive patterns (how English actually works) and prescriptive conventions (what formal contexts expect). The good news is that explicit knowledge about grammar—the kind this textbook provides—can support both L1 literacy development and L2 language learning.

Understanding this distinction also helps teachers and writers be more precise. A native speaker who writes "Me and him went to the store" isn't making a language acquisition error—they've acquired a descriptive pattern that differs from the prestige standard. What they need is information about when the standard form is expected, not remediation for a deficiency. An L2 learner who writes the same sentence might be producing an error that reflects incomplete acquisition of English case marking. The same surface error can have different causes, and effective teaching responds to the cause.

## Homework: Prescriptive vs. Descriptive Grammar

### Part A: Analysis

*Question 1.* Identify *two prescriptive rules* you were explicitly taught in school or by family members. For each rule:

- State the rule as you learned it
- Describe how closely you follow this rule. When do you follow it, and when do you not?
- Evaluate: Does following this rule improve clarity, or does it primarily signal formality/education?

*Question 2.* The chapter presents a "quick test": if violating a rule still produces comprehensible English, it's probably prescriptive; if it produces gibberish, it's descriptive. Test this with *three examples* from your own speech or writing. Which category does each fall into?

### Part B: Application

*Question 3.* Think back to feedback you've received on your writing—from teachers, professors, tutors, peers, or others. Identify *two specific pieces of advice or corrections* you've received. For each one:

- Describe the feedback (what were you told to change or avoid?)
- Classify it: Was this feedback about a *descriptive rule* (a pattern of how English works) or a *prescriptive rule* (a convention about how English "should" be used)?
- Evaluate the impact: If you consistently followed this advice, how would it affect your writing? Would it improve clarity? Change your voice or tone? Limit your options? Help you in certain contexts but not others?

*Question 4.* The chapter argues that prescriptive rules often function as "social markers" that benefit people who already speak prestige varieties. In 1–2 paragraphs, respond: Do you find this argument convincing? What are the implications for how we should think about "correct" English in schools and workplaces?

## Glossary

**Critical period hypothesis**: The theory that there is a window in early childhood during which language acquisition is easiest and most complete; after this period, language learning becomes more difficult.

**Descriptive rule**: A pattern that describes how speakers actually use language; acquired naturally through exposure rather than explicit instruction.

**Hypercorrection**: An incorrect use of language that results from an attempt to apply a prescriptive rule in contexts where it doesn't belong (e.g., using "whom" as a subject because the speaker believes it sounds more formal).

**First language (L1)**: The language acquired from caregivers and community members in early childhood; also called native language.

**Inflection**: A change in the form of a word (usually by adding an ending) to indicate grammatical features like tense, number, or case.

**Intuition (linguistic)**: A native speaker's unconscious knowledge about what is grammatical in their language.

**Negative concord**: The use of multiple negative elements in a sentence for emphasis; a feature of many language varieties that prescriptive grammar stigmatizes.

**Overgeneralization**: The application of a grammatical rule to cases where it doesn't apply (e.g., "goed" for "went"), indicating that learners are extracting rules rather than just memorizing forms.

**Prescriptive rule**: A rule that states how language *should* be used according to some standard; typically taught explicitly and often based on tradition, social convention, or the usage of prestigious groups.

**Preposition stranding**: Leaving a preposition at the end of a clause rather than fronting it with its object; natural in English despite prescriptive objections.

**Register**: A variety of language appropriate for a particular context, audience, or purpose (e.g., formal, informal, technical).

**Second language (L2)**: Any language learned after the first language is established; L2 acquisition typically requires more explicit instruction than L1 acquisition.

**Serial comma (Oxford comma)**: A comma placed before the final conjunction in a series of three or more items (e.g., "red, white, and blue").

**Singular "they"**: The use of "they" to refer to a single person, especially when the person's gender is unknown or nonbinary; increasingly accepted in standard usage.

**Split infinitive**: An infinitive with an adverb placed between "to" and the verb (e.g., "to boldly go"); prohibited by prescriptive tradition but widely used by good writers.

**Standard variety**: The variety of a language that is used in formal and institutional contexts and typically associated with education and social prestige.

**Style guide**: A publication that prescribes rules for writing, including matters of grammar, punctuation, and formatting (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).

**Tacit knowledge**: Knowledge that speakers have and use without conscious awareness; the implicit grammatical knowledge that allows native speakers to judge sentences.
