## 13.1 Adjectives vs. Adjectivals: Form vs. Function

Understanding the distinction between **adjectives** (a form/part of speech) and **adjectivals** (a function) is essential for accurate grammatical analysis.

### Adjective as Form

An **adjective** is a part of speech—a word class with particular morphological and syntactic characteristics (Chapter 5). Adjectives can be graded, appear between determiners and nouns, follow linking verbs, and be modified by *very*.

- *tall*, *beautiful*, *interesting*, *happy*

### Adjectival as Function

An **adjectival** is any word, phrase, or clause that **functions** to modify a noun, answering questions like "which one?" or "what kind?"

**Key insight**: All attributive adjectives are adjectivals, but not all adjectivals are adjectives.

---

## 13.2 Structures That Function as Adjectivals

Many different structures can serve the adjectival function.

### 1. Adjective Phrases

The prototypical adjectival is an adjective phrase:

- *the **tall** man*
- *a **very interesting** book*
- *someone **happy about the news***

### 2. Nouns (Attributive)

Nouns can function adjectivally when they modify other nouns:

- *the **coffee** table*
- *a **government** report*
- *the **history** professor*
- ***car** insurance*

These are sometimes called "noun adjuncts" or "attributive nouns."

### 3. Prepositional Phrases

Prepositional phrases commonly function as adjectivals (post-modifiers):

- *the man **in the hat***
- *a book **about grammar***
- *the house **on the corner***
- *a sense **of accomplishment***

### 4. Relative Clauses

Clauses introduced by relative pronouns/adverbs function as adjectivals:

- *the book **that I read***
- *the student **who won the prize***
- *the place **where we met***
- *the reason **why she left***

### 5. Participial Phrases

Present and past participial phrases function as adjectivals:

- *the **running** water*
- *the **broken** window*
- *the man **standing by the door***
- *the book **written by Hemingway***

### 6. Infinitive Phrases

Infinitive phrases can function adjectivally:

- *a book **to read***
- *the decision **to leave***
- *something **to eat***
- *the first person **to arrive***

---

## 13.3 Relative Clauses in Detail

**Relative clauses** (also called adjective clauses) modify nouns, specifying which entity is meant.

### Structure

A relative clause consists of a relative word + clause content:

```
Relative Clause = Relative Word + Subject + Predicate
                  (or: Relative Word as Subject + Predicate)
```

- *the book **that** I read* (that = object of "read")
- *the student **who** won* (who = subject of "won")

### Relative Pronouns

| Pronoun | Use | Example |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **who** | subject (people) | *the man **who** arrived* |
| **whom** | object (people, formal) | *the man **whom** I saw* |
| **whose** | possessive (people/things) | *the author **whose** book I read* |
| **which** | subject/object (things) | *the book **which** I read* |
| **that** | subject/object (people/things) | *the book **that** I read* |

### Relative Adverbs

| Adverb | Use | Example |
|--------|-----|---------|
| **where** | place | *the city **where** I was born* |
| **when** | time | *the day **when** we met* |
| **why** | reason | *the reason **why** she left* |

### That vs. Which

In American English:
- **That** is preferred for restrictive clauses
- **Which** is preferred for non-restrictive clauses

- Restrictive: *The book **that** I recommended is excellent.*
- Non-restrictive: *This book, **which** I recommended, is excellent.*

### Zero Relative

When the relative pronoun is the object, it can be omitted:

- *the book **(that)** I read*
- *the man **(whom)** I saw*
- *the person **(that)** she called*

This cannot be done when the relative is the subject:
- *the man **who** arrived* (not *~~the man arrived~~*)

---

## 13.4 Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive Modifiers

This distinction is crucial for meaning and punctuation.

### Restrictive Modifiers

**Restrictive modifiers** (also called defining or identifying) limit the reference of the noun—they identify *which one* is meant. Without them, the sentence's meaning would be different.

- *The students **who studied** passed.* (only those who studied)
- *The book **that she recommended** changed my life.*
- *Cars **with manual transmissions** are becoming rare.*

**Characteristics**:
- No commas
- Essential for identifying the referent
- Removing them changes meaning significantly
- Use *that* for clauses (preferred in American English)

### Non-Restrictive Modifiers

**Non-restrictive modifiers** (also called non-defining or supplementary) add extra information about an already-identified referent. They could be removed without changing the basic identification.

- *My sister, **who lives in Boston**, visited last week.* (I have one sister)
- *The book, **which she recommended**, changed my life.* (book already identified)
- *Paris, **known for its cuisine**, attracts millions of tourists.*

**Characteristics**:
- Set off with commas
- Add supplementary information
- Can be removed without losing identification
- Use *which* for clauses (not *that*)

### The Meaning Difference

Compare:
- *The students who studied passed.* (restrictive—only studying students)
- *The students, who studied, passed.* (non-restrictive—all students studied and passed)

With proper nouns, most modifiers are non-restrictive (since proper nouns are already uniquely identified):
- *Shakespeare, **who wrote Hamlet**, lived in Stratford.*

---

## 13.5 Participial Phrases as Adjectivals

Participial phrases—built on present participles (*-ing*) or past participles (*-ed/-en*)—function as adjectivals.

### Present Participial Phrases

Express ongoing action or state:

- *the woman **talking on the phone***
- *students **waiting in line***
- *a child **playing in the park***

### Past Participial Phrases

Express completed action or state, often passive in meaning:

- *the report **written by the committee***
- *a house **built in 1920***
- *the problem **discussed earlier***

### Reduced Relative Clauses

Participial phrases can often be seen as reduced relative clauses:

- *the woman **who is talking*** → *the woman **talking***
- *the report **that was written*** → *the report **written***

### Position

Participial phrases typically follow the noun:
- *the man **standing by the door***
- *the book **published last year***

But single-word participles often precede the noun:
- *the **running** water*
- *the **broken** window*

### Dangling Participles

Participial phrases must clearly modify the intended noun. **Dangling participles** occur when the modifier doesn't logically connect:

- *~~**Walking down the street**, the trees were beautiful.~~* (trees weren't walking)
- Correct: ***Walking down the street**, I noticed the beautiful trees.*

---

## 13.6 Adjectival Positions

Adjectivals can appear in different positions relative to the noun.

### Pre-modification (Attributive Position Before Noun)

Single adjectives and some phrases appear before the noun:

- *the **tall** man*
- *a **very interesting** book*
- ***running** water*
- *the **government** report*

### Post-modification (After Noun)

Longer phrases and clauses follow the noun:

- *the man **in the hat***
- *a book **about grammar***
- *the student **who won the prize***
- *the report **published yesterday***

### Predicative Position (After Linking Verb)

Adjective phrases also appear as subject complements:

- *The man is **tall**.*
- *The book seems **interesting**.*
- *She became **happy about the news**.*

Note: Some adjectives only work attributively (*the **main** reason*, not *~~the reason is main~~*), while others only work predicatively (*the child is **asleep***, not *~~the asleep child~~*).

---

## 13.7 Stacking Adjectivals

Multiple adjectivals can modify the same noun.

### Order of Pre-modifiers

When multiple adjectives precede a noun, they typically follow this order:

1. Determiner: *the, a, my*
2. Opinion: *beautiful, interesting*
3. Size: *big, small*
4. Age: *old, new*
5. Shape: *round, square*
6. Color: *red, blue*
7. Origin: *French, American*
8. Material: *wooden, metal*
9. Purpose: *cooking, reading*
10. NOUN

- *a beautiful large old round red French wooden cooking pot*

### Multiple Post-modifiers

Post-modifiers can stack, but order matters for meaning:

- *the book **on the table** **that I mentioned***
- *the man **in the hat** **standing by the door***

Each post-modifier attaches to the preceding NP.

### Part 1: Identification and Classification (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each sentence, identify the underlined adjectival and classify its form (adjective phrase, prepositional phrase, relative clause, participial phrase, infinitive phrase, or noun).

#### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *The **extremely talented** musician performed last night.*

- Form: adjective phrase
- Function: modifies *musician*

---

**1.** *The book **on the top shelf** belongs to my professor.*

Form:

**2.** *The woman **who won the award** gave an inspiring speech.*

Form:

**3.** *The **broken** window needs to be repaired immediately.*

Form:

**4.** *I need something **to eat** before the meeting.*

Form:

**5.** *The **government** report was released yesterday.*

Form:

**6.** *The students **waiting in line** seemed impatient.*

Form:

**7.** *We found a **very comfortable** chair at the antique store.*

Form:

---

### Part 2: Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each sentence, indicate whether the underlined modifier is restrictive (R) or non-restrictive (NR). Explain your reasoning.

#### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *My sister, who lives in Portland, is visiting next week.*

- Type: Non-restrictive (NR)
- Reasoning: The commas indicate this adds extra information; the speaker has only one sister, so the clause doesn't identify which sister.

---

**8.** *The students who completed the extra assignment received bonus points.*

Type:

Reasoning:

**9.** *The Eiffel Tower, which was built in 1889, attracts millions of visitors.*

Type:

Reasoning:

**10.** *The car that I bought last year already needs repairs.*

Type:

Reasoning:

**11.** *My neighbor's dog, a golden retriever, barks every morning.*
