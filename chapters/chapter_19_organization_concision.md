## 19.1 Organizing Information

How you arrange information within and across sentences affects how easily readers follow your ideas.

### The Given-New Contract

Effective prose moves from **given** (known) information to **new** information:

**Given**: What the reader already knows
**New**: What you're adding

- *The study examined workplace stress. **This stress** affects employee health.*

The second sentence begins with given information (*This stress*—referring to what we just discussed) and ends with new information (*affects employee health*).

### Violating the Contract

When new information comes first, readers struggle:

- *~~Employee health is affected by this stress.~~* (new before given)

Readers work harder because they encounter unknown information before they've been oriented.

### Topic and Comment

Sentences typically have a **topic** (what the sentence is about) and a **comment** (what's said about it).

- **Topic**: *The proposal*
- **Comment**: *was rejected by the committee.*

Keeping topics consistent helps readers track your ideas:

- *The proposal was submitted last week. **It** was reviewed by experts. **The proposal** was ultimately approved.*

Shifting topics erratically creates confusion.

## 19.2 End-Focus and End-Weight

### End-Focus

English naturally stresses sentence-final position. Place important information at the end:

- *The winner was **Maria**.* (focus on Maria)
- ***Maria** won the competition.* (focus on winning)

### End-Weight

Heavy (long, complex) elements work better at sentence end:

- Awkward: ***That she would resign after thirty years** surprised everyone.*
- Better: *It surprised everyone **that she would resign after thirty years**.*

This is why extraposition and passive voice are useful—they help manage end-weight.

---

## 19.3 Cohesion and Coherence

### Cohesion

**Cohesion** refers to the linguistic ties between sentences:

- **Repetition**: *The proposal... This proposal...*
- **Pronouns**: *The committee... They...*
- **Synonyms**: *The building... The structure...*
- **Conjunctions**: *However*, *Therefore*, *In addition*

### Coherence

**Coherence** is the logical connection of ideas. Text can be cohesive without being coherent if the ideas don't logically connect.

Both are needed for readable prose.

## 19.4 Concision: Eliminating Wordiness

Concise writing says what needs to be said without unnecessary words.

### Redundant Pairs

Eliminate words that repeat meaning:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| *basic fundamentals* | *basics* or *fundamentals* |
| *true facts* | *facts* |
| *past history* | *history* |
| *future plans* | *plans* |
| *consensus of opinion* | *consensus* |
| *completely unanimous* | *unanimous* |

### Meaningless Modifiers

Remove words that add nothing:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| *really quite interesting* | *interesting* |
| *very unique* | *unique* |
| *absolutely essential* | *essential* |
| *completely finished* | *finished* |

### Wordy Phrases

Replace phrases with single words:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| *at this point in time* | *now* |
| *in the event that* | *if* |
| *due to the fact that* | *because* |
| *in order to* | *to* |
| *a large number of* | *many* |
| *is able to* | *can* |
| *has the ability to* | *can* |
| *make a decision* | *decide* |
| *give consideration to* | *consider* |

### Empty Sentence Starters

Avoid weak openings:

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| *It is important to note that...* | (just state it) |
| *There are many people who believe...* | *Many people believe...* |
| *It is my opinion that...* | (just state your opinion) |
| *The reason why is because...* | *The reason is...* or *because* |

---

## 19.5 Nominalization and Verb Strength

**Nominalization** is turning a verb into a noun. While sometimes useful, excessive nominalization creates wordy, weak prose.

### The Problem

| Nominalized (wordy) | Verbal (concise) |
|---------------------|------------------|
| *make an examination of* | *examine* |
| *give consideration to* | *consider* |
| *conduct an investigation of* | *investigate* |
| *reach a conclusion* | *conclude* |
| *provide assistance to* | *assist* |

### When Nominalization Works

Nominalizations are useful when the noun form serves a specific purpose:

- **As subjects**: *The investigation revealed problems.* (investigation as topic)
- **To refer back**: *This decision was controversial.* (referring to previous content)

The key is avoiding unnecessary nominalization that buries the action.

---

## 19.6 Active vs. Passive for Concision

Active voice is often more concise than passive:

- Passive: *The report was written by the committee.* (8 words)
- Active: *The committee wrote the report.* (5 words)

However, passive can be more concise when the agent is obvious or irrelevant:

- Active: *Someone stole my car.* (4 words)
- Passive: *My car was stolen.* (4 words—same length, but agent-free)

Choose based on what's most efficient for your purpose.

## 19.7 Revision Strategies

### The Shrink Test

Can you cut 10-20% of your draft without losing meaning? Most first drafts can be tightened significantly.

### Read Aloud

Wordy passages often sound awkward when read aloud. Trust your ear.

### Ask "Do I need this word?"

For every word, ask whether removing it would change meaning. If not, consider cutting it.

### Watch for Patterns

If you frequently use certain wordy constructions (*it is*, *there are*, *the fact that*), search for them specifically during revision.

### Part 5: Application and Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)

**14.** Find a paragraph from your own writing (an essay, email, report, etc.). Apply the "shrink test": try to cut 15-20% of the words without losing meaning.

Original paragraph (with word count):

Revised paragraph (with word count):

What did you cut? Were there patterns in your wordiness?

**15.** The chapter suggests that concision is not about being brief at all costs—it's about saying what needs to be said without unnecessary words. In 1-2 paragraphs, reflect: When might wordiness be a problem in your writing? Are there contexts where more formal, elaborate language might actually be appropriate?
