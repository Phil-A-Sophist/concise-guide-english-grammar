## 7.1 Identifying Verbs

Verbs are the engine of the sentence—they express actions, states, or occurrences and typically form the core of the predicate. As with nouns, we identify verbs through morphological and syntactic tests rather than relying on meaning alone.

### Morphological Tests (Form)

**Test 1: Past tense formation**

Verbs can be inflected for past tense:
- *walk* → *walked*
- *see* → *saw*
- *go* → *went*

**Test 2: Third-person singular present**

Verbs take *-s* in third-person singular present:
- *I walk* → *she walks*
- *I see* → *he sees*
- *I go* → *it goes*

**Test 3: Progressive form (-ing)**

Verbs can take the progressive suffix:
- *walk* → *walking*
- *see* → *seeing*
- *go* → *going*

**Test 4: Past participle form**

Verbs have a past participle (often with *-ed* or *-en*):
- *walk* → *walked*
- *see* → *seen*
- *go* → *gone*

### Syntactic Tests (Function)

**Test 1: Modal auxiliary test**

Verbs can follow modal auxiliaries (*can*, *will*, *might*, *should*, *must*):
- *can walk*
- *will see*
- *might go*

**Test 2: Infinitive marker test**

Verbs can follow *to*:
- *to walk*
- *to see*
- *to go*

**Test 3: Object test**

Many verbs (transitive verbs) can take an object:
- *kick the ball*
- *read the book*
- *see the movie*

**Test 4: Negation test**

Verbs can be negated with *not* (usually with auxiliary *do*):
- *She does not walk.*
- *I did not see it.*

### Practice: Applying the Tests

Is *discover* a verb?

**Morphological tests:**
- Past tense: *discovered* ✓
- Third-person singular: *she discovers* ✓
- Progressive: *discovering* ✓
- Past participle: *discovered* ✓

**Syntactic tests:**
- Follows modal: *can discover* ✓
- Follows *to*: *to discover* ✓
- Takes object: *discover the truth* ✓

Result: *discover* is definitely a verb.

## 7.2 Verb Forms

Every English verb has multiple forms. Understanding these forms is essential for analyzing verb phrases and understanding tense, aspect, and voice.

### The Principal Parts

English verbs have four or five principal parts:

| Form | Regular | Irregular | Irregular |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Base** | walk | see | go |
| **Past** | walked | saw | went |
| **Past participle** | walked | seen | gone |
| **Present participle** | walking | seeing | going |
| **3rd person singular** | walks | sees | goes |

### Regular vs. Irregular Verbs

**Regular verbs** form the past tense and past participle by adding *-ed*:
- *walk* → *walked* → *walked*
- *jump* → *jumped* → *jumped*
- *discover* → *discovered* → *discovered*

**Irregular verbs** have unpredictable forms that must be memorized:
- *see* → *saw* → *seen*
- *go* → *went* → *gone*
- *sing* → *sang* → *sung*
- *be* → *was/were* → *been*
- *have* → *had* → *had*

### Forms in Use

Each form appears in specific grammatical contexts:

**Base form:**
- After modals: *She **can swim**.*
- Infinitive (with *to*): *I want **to swim**.*
- Imperative: ***Swim** faster!*
- Present tense (except 3rd person): *I **swim**, you **swim**, they **swim**.*

**Past form:**
- Simple past tense: *She **swam** yesterday.*

**Past participle:**
- Perfect aspect (with *have*): *She **has swum** many times.*
- Passive voice (with *be*): *The race **was swum** quickly.*

**Present participle (-ing):**
- Progressive aspect (with *be*): *She **is swimming**.*
- As adjective: *the **swimming** pool*
- As gerund (noun): ***Swimming** is fun.*

**3rd person singular (-s):**
- Present tense: *She **swims** well.*

---

## 7.3 Main Verbs and Auxiliary Verbs

Verb phrases often contain more than one verb. The **main verb** (also called the lexical verb) carries the primary meaning, while **auxiliary verbs** (also called helping verbs) add grammatical information.

### Main Verbs

The main verb is the head of the verb phrase. It expresses the core action or state:
- *She **walks** home.*
- *They have **eaten** dinner.*
- *The book was **written** by Maria.*

### Primary Auxiliaries

The three primary auxiliary verbs—*be*, *have*, and *do*—help form tenses, aspects, and other constructions.

**Be** (forms: *am*, *is*, *are*, *was*, *were*, *been*, *being*):
- Progressive aspect: *She **is reading**.*
- Passive voice: *The book **was written**.*

**Have** (forms: *have*, *has*, *had*, *having*):
- Perfect aspect: *She **has finished**.*
- *They **had left** before I arrived.*

**Do** (forms: *do*, *does*, *did*):
- Negation: *She **does not** know.*
- Questions: ***Did** you see it?*
- Emphasis: *I **do** understand.*

### Modal Auxiliaries

**Modal verbs** express necessity, possibility, ability, permission, and similar meanings. They form a closed class:

*can*, *could*, *will*, *would*, *shall*, *should*, *may*, *might*, *must*

**Characteristics of modals:**
- No *-s* form: *she can* (not ~~*she cans*~~)
- No infinitive: ~~*to can*~~
- No participles: ~~*canning*~~, ~~*canned*~~
- Followed by base form: *can swim* (not ~~*can swimming*~~)

**Examples:**
- Ability: *She **can** speak French.*
- Possibility: *It **might** rain.*
- Necessity: *You **must** leave.*
- Permission: *You **may** enter.*
- Future: *We **will** see.*

### Semi-modals

Some verbs behave partly like modals:
- *have to*, *need to*, *ought to*, *used to*, *be going to*

These take *to* and can be inflected:
- *She **has to** leave.* (compare: *She **must** leave.*)
- *He **needs to** study.* (compare: *He **should** study.*)

---

## 7.4 Verb Phrase Structure

A **verb phrase (VP)** consists of a main verb and any auxiliaries that accompany it. The main verb is the **head** of the phrase.

### VP Patterns

**Simple VP** (main verb only):
- *She **sleeps**.*
- *They **discovered** the truth.*

**VP with modal:**
- *She **can sleep**.*
- *They **will discover** it.*

**VP with perfect aspect:**
- *She **has slept**.*
- *They **have discovered** it.*

**VP with progressive aspect:**
- *She **is sleeping**.*
- *They **are discovering** it.*

**VP with passive voice:**
- *It **was discovered**.*
- *The book **is being read**.*

**Complex VP** (multiple auxiliaries):
- *She **has been sleeping**.* (perfect + progressive)
- *It **will have been discovered**.* (modal + perfect + passive)

### Order of Auxiliaries

When multiple auxiliaries occur, they appear in a fixed order:

**Modal → Perfect (*have*) → Progressive (*be*) → Passive (*be*) → Main Verb**

- Modal + Main: *will **eat***
- Perfect + Main: *has **eaten***
- Progressive + Main: *is **eating***
- Passive + Main: *was **eaten***
- Modal + Perfect + Main: *will have **eaten***
- Perfect + Progressive + Main: *has been **eating***
- Modal + Perfect + Progressive + Passive + Main: *will have been being **eaten*** (grammatical but rare)

### Each Auxiliary Determines the Next Form

Each auxiliary determines the form of the following verb:

| Auxiliary | Following form | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Modal | Base | will **eat** |
| Perfect (*have*) | Past participle | has **eaten** |
| Progressive (*be*) | Present participle | is **eating** |
| Passive (*be*) | Past participle | was **eaten** |

**Examples:**
- *She **has eaten**.* (have → past participle)
- *She **is eating**.* (be progressive → -ing)
- *She **has been eating**.* (have → past participle *been*; be → -ing)

---

## 7.5 Finite and Non-Finite Verbs

Verbs can be classified as **finite** or **non-finite** based on whether they show tense and agreement.

### Finite Verbs

**Finite verbs** are marked for tense (past/present) and agree with the subject:
- *She **walks** to school.* (present, 3rd person)
- *They **walked** home.* (past)
- *I **am** happy.* (present, 1st person)

Every complete sentence must have at least one finite verb.

### Non-Finite Verbs

**Non-finite verbs** are not marked for tense or agreement. They include:

**Infinitives** (base form, often with *to*):
- *I want **to go**.*
- *She helped him **carry** the boxes.*

**Present participles** (*-ing* form):
- ***Running** quickly, she caught the bus.* (participial phrase)
- *I enjoy **reading**.* (gerund)

**Past participles** (*-ed/-en* form):
- ***Exhausted** by the journey, he slept.* (participial phrase)
- *The **broken** window needs repair.* (adjectival)

### Gerunds vs. Present Participles

Both gerunds and present participles have the *-ing* form, but they function differently:

**Gerund** (functions as noun):
- ***Swimming** is fun.* (subject)
- *I enjoy **reading**.* (object)

**Present participle** (functions as adjective or in progressive):
- *The **swimming** pool is closed.* (adjective)
- *She is **swimming**.* (progressive aspect)

## Form and Function Tests

### Identifying Verb Phrases

To identify a VP:

1. **Find the main verb** using verb tests
2. **Look left for auxiliaries** (modals, *have*, *be*)
3. **Check the order**: modal → perfect → progressive → passive → main
4. **Verify forms**: each auxiliary determines the following form

### Example Analysis

*The book should have been being read by students.*

**Analysis:**
- Main verb: *read* (past participle—passive)
- Auxiliaries (right to left):
  - *being* (progressive *be* → passive *be* takes past participle)
  - *been* (perfect *have* → progressive *be* takes past participle)
  - *have* (modal → perfect *have* takes base form)
  - *should* (modal)

**VP:** *should have been being read*
- Modal + Perfect + Progressive + Passive + Main

4. Passive + main verb
5. Modal + perfect + main verb
6. Perfect + progressive + main verb
7. Modal + passive + main verb

### Activity 2: Form Sequencing

For each verb phrase, verify that the forms are correct by checking that each auxiliary determines the following form.

1. *has been singing* ✓ or ✗?
2. *will have wrote* ✓ or ✗?
3. *is being constructed* ✓ or ✗?
4. *should has left* ✓ or ✗?
5. *might have been seen* ✓ or ✗?

## Chapter Summary

- **Verbs** are identified through morphological tests (past tense, 3rd person *-s*, *-ing*, past participle) and syntactic tests (follows modal, follows *to*, takes object).
- Verbs have multiple **forms**: base, past, past participle, present participle, 3rd person singular.
- **Main verbs** carry meaning; **auxiliary verbs** add grammatical information.
- **Primary auxiliaries** (*be*, *have*, *do*) form aspects and voices; **modal auxiliaries** (*can*, *will*, *must*, etc.) express necessity, possibility, and related meanings.
- Auxiliaries appear in a fixed **order**: Modal → Perfect → Progressive → Passive → Main.
- Each **auxiliary determines the form** of the following verb.
- **Finite verbs** show tense and agreement; **non-finite verbs** (infinitives, participles) do not.
