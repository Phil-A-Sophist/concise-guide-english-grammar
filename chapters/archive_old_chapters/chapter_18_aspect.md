## 18.1 What Is Aspect?

**Aspect** is a grammatical category that describes how an event unfolds over time—whether it's completed, ongoing, or habitual. While tense locates events in time (past/present), aspect describes the internal structure of the event.

### Tense vs. Aspect

| Category | Question | Marked by |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Tense | When? | Verb inflection |
| Aspect | How does it unfold? | Auxiliary + verb form |

English has two aspects that combine with two tenses:

|  | Simple | Progressive | Perfect | Perfect Progressive |
|--|--------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Present** | walks | is walking | has walked | has been walking |
| **Past** | walked | was walking | had walked | had been walking |

---

## 18.2 Simple Aspect

**Simple aspect** presents events as complete wholes without internal structure.

### Uses

**Habitual actions:**
- *She **walks** to school every day.*

**States:**
- *He **knows** the answer.*

**Completed events:**
- *She **walked** to school yesterday.*

**General truths:**
- *Water **boils** at 100°C.*

---

## 18.3 Progressive Aspect

**Progressive aspect** (also called continuous) presents events as ongoing or in progress. It's formed with *be* + present participle (-ing).

### Formation

| Tense | Form | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Present | am/is/are + -ing | *She **is working**.* |
| Past | was/were + -ing | *She **was working**.* |

### Uses

**Action in progress:**
- *She **is reading** a book right now.*
- *They **were sleeping** when I called.*

**Temporary situation:**
- *I**'m living** with my parents this summer.*

**Future arrangement:**
- *We **are meeting** them tomorrow.*

**Repeated action (with annoyance):**
- *He**'s always losing** his keys!*

### Stative Verbs

Some verbs rarely appear in progressive because they describe states, not actions:

**Mental states:** *know, believe, understand, remember, forget*
**Emotions:** *love, hate, like, want, need*
**Possession:** *have, own, possess, belong*
**Senses:** *see, hear, smell, taste* (perception)
**Being:** *be, exist, seem, appear*

- ✗ *I **am knowing** the answer.*
- ✓ *I **know** the answer.*

Some stative verbs can be progressive with different meanings:
- *I **have** a car.* (possession—stative)
- *I**'m having** lunch.* (eating—active)

## 18.4 Perfect Aspect

**Perfect aspect** connects an earlier situation to a later time. It's formed with *have* + past participle.

### Formation

| Tense | Form | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Present | have/has + past participle | *She **has finished**.* |
| Past | had + past participle | *She **had finished**.* |

### Uses of Present Perfect

**Experience (indefinite past):**
- *I **have visited** Paris.* (at some time)
- *She **has never eaten** sushi.*

**Recent past with present relevance:**
- *I **have lost** my keys.* (so I can't get in)
- *She **has broken** her leg.* (so she can't walk)

**Situation continuing to present:**
- *I **have lived** here for ten years.* (still living)
- *She **has known** him since childhood.*

### Uses of Past Perfect

**Earlier past (before another past event):**
- *When I arrived, she **had** already **left**.*
- *I realized I **had forgotten** my wallet.*

### Present Perfect vs. Simple Past

| Present Perfect | Simple Past |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Indefinite time | Definite time |
| Connected to now | Completed, detached |

- *I **have seen** that movie.* (indefinite—still relevant)
- *I **saw** that movie yesterday.* (definite time)

---

## 18.5 Perfect Progressive

**Perfect progressive** combines both aspects: an event that started earlier and continued (often up to a reference point). It's formed with *have* + *been* + -ing.

### Formation

| Tense | Form | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Present | have/has been + -ing | *She **has been working**.* |
| Past | had been + -ing | *She **had been working**.* |

### Uses

**Duration up to now (or past reference):**
- *I **have been waiting** for an hour.*
- *She **had been studying** all night before the exam.*

**Recent activity with visible results:**
- *Your eyes are red. **Have** you **been crying**?*
- *The ground is wet. It **has been raining**.*

### Perfect vs. Perfect Progressive

| Perfect | Perfect Progressive |
|---------|---------------------|
| Emphasizes completion | Emphasizes duration/continuation |
| *I **have read** the book.* | *I **have been reading** the book.* |
