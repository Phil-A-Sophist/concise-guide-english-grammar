## 25.1 Grammar and Clarity

Clear writing depends on sound grammatical structure.

### Subject-Verb Agreement

Ensure subjects and verbs agree:
- ✗ *The list of items **are** long.*
- ✓ *The list of items **is** long.*

### Clear Pronoun Reference

Pronouns must clearly refer to antecedents:
- ✗ *When John met Bob, **he** was tired.* (who?)
- ✓ *When John met Bob, **John** was tired.*

### Parallel Structure

Coordinate elements must have the same form:
- ✗ *She likes **reading**, **to swim**, and **hiking**.*
- ✓ *She likes **reading**, **swimming**, and **hiking**.*

### Modifier Placement

Place modifiers near what they modify:
- ✗ *She **only** ate vegetables.* (ambiguous)
- ✓ *She ate **only** vegetables.*

## 25.2 Information Flow

Effective writing manages how information flows through sentences.

### Given Before New

Start with familiar information, end with new:
- **(Given)** *The report arrived yesterday.* **(New)** *It was written by Maria.*

### End-Focus

Important information goes at the end:
- Weak: *A solution is what we need.*
- Strong: *What we need is **a solution**.*

### Topic Continuity

Keep the same topic as subject for coherence:
- *The committee met. **It** reviewed the proposals. **The proposals** were then ranked.*

---

## 25.3 Active vs. Passive Voice

Choose voice strategically:

### Use Active For:
- Direct, clear statements
- Emphasis on the agent
- Conciseness

*The committee rejected the proposal.*

### Use Passive For:
- Unknown/unimportant agent
- Emphasis on receiver
- Topic continuity
- Scientific/formal writing

*The proposal was rejected.* (agent unimportant)

---

## 25.4 Sentence Variety

Vary sentence structure to engage readers.

### Mix Lengths
- Short sentences: emphasis, clarity
- Longer sentences: complexity, flow

### Vary Beginnings
- Subject first: *John walked away.*
- Adverb first: *Slowly, John walked away.*
- Participial phrase: *Turning abruptly, John walked away.*

### Mix Types
- Simple, compound, complex, compound-complex

---

## 25.5 Common Problems and Solutions

### Fragments

Missing subject or predicate:
- ✗ *Because I was tired.*
- ✓ *I left because I was tired.*

### Run-ons and Comma Splices

- ✗ *It rained, we stayed home.*
- ✓ *It rained, **so** we stayed home.*

### Dangling Modifiers

- ✗ ***Running quickly**, the bus was caught.*
- ✓ ***Running quickly**, she caught the bus.*

### Faulty Predication

Subject and predicate must fit logically:
- ✗ *The cost of the project is **too expensive**.*
- ✓ *The project is **too expensive**.*

---

## 25.6 Editing Process

1. **Read aloud** - hear awkward constructions
2. **Check subjects and verbs** - agreement, clarity
3. **Verify pronoun reference** - clear antecedents
4. **Examine parallelism** - coordinate elements match
5. **Assess information flow** - given before new
6. **Vary structures** - sentence types and lengths

---

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Diagnose and Fix

Identify and correct the grammatical problem.

1. *Running quickly, the bus was caught.*
2. *The list of problems are overwhelming.*
3. *She not only runs but also is swimming.*
4. *When John met Bob, he was tired.*

### Exercise 2: Improve Information Flow

Rewrite for better given/new organization.

1. *A serious problem is what this represents.*
2. *By the committee, the report was reviewed.*

### Exercise 3: Create Variety

Rewrite this paragraph with varied sentence structures:

*She went to the store. She bought groceries. She came home. She made dinner. She ate alone.*

## Chapter Summary

- **Clarity** depends on agreement, clear reference, parallelism, and modifier placement.
- **Information flow** puts given before new and important information at the end.
- Choose **active or passive** voice strategically based on purpose.
- **Vary** sentence structure for engagement.
- **Edit** systematically for grammatical precision.
