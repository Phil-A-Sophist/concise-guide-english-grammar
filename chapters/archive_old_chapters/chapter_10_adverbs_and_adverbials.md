## 10.1 Identifying Adverbs

Adverbs are the most versatile modifiers in English. They can modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, and entire sentences. As with other word classes, we identify adverbs through formal and functional tests.

### Morphological Tests (Form)

**Test 1: The -ly suffix**

Many (not all) adverbs end in *-ly*, formed from adjectives:
- *quick* → *quickly*
- *happy* → *happily*
- *careful* → *carefully*
- *sudden* → *suddenly*

**Test 2: Comparative/superlative forms**

Some adverbs can be graded:
- *fast* → *faster* → *fastest*
- *soon* → *sooner* → *soonest*
- *quickly* → *more quickly* → *most quickly*

**Caution:** Many common adverbs don't fit these patterns:
- *very*, *always*, *never*, *often*, *however*, *therefore*

These must be identified by syntactic tests.

### Syntactic Tests (Function)

**Test 1: Modifies verbs**

Adverbs typically appear near verbs and modify them:
- *She spoke **quietly**.*
- *He **always** arrives late.*
- *They **suddenly** disappeared.*

**Test 2: Modifies adjectives**

Adverbs can modify adjectives:
- *a **very** tall building*
- *an **extremely** difficult problem*
- ***surprisingly** easy*

**Test 3: Modifies other adverbs**

Adverbs can modify other adverbs:
- *She spoke **very** quietly.*
- *He runs **quite** fast.*
- *It happened **rather** suddenly.*

**Test 4: Modifies sentences**

Adverbs can modify entire sentences:
- ***Unfortunately**, I can't attend.*
- ***Clearly**, we have a problem.*
- ***Apparently**, they've left.*

**Test 5: Cannot appear between determiner and noun**

Unlike adjectives, adverbs cannot appear in the attributive position:
- *the tall man* ✓ (adjective)
- ~~*the quickly man*~~ ✗ (adverb)
- ~~*the often problem*~~ ✗ (adverb)

### Practice: Applying the Tests

Is *gradually* an adverb?

**Morphological tests:**
- Ends in *-ly*: *gradual* → *gradually* ✓
- Comparative: *more gradually* ✓

**Syntactic tests:**
- Modifies verb: *The temperature gradually rose.* ✓
- Modifies adjective: *gradually increasing pressure* ✓
- Cannot modify noun directly: ~~*the gradually man*~~ ✓

Result: *gradually* is definitely an adverb.

## 10.2 Adverbs vs. Adverbials: Form and Function

Like adjectives/adjectivals, we must distinguish between **adverb** (form) and **adverbial** (function).

### Adverb as Form

An **adverb** is a part of speech—a word with adverb characteristics (often *-ly*, cannot modify nouns directly).

### Adverbial as Function

An **adverbial** is any word or structure that functions to modify a verb, adjective, adverb, or sentence. Many adverbials are adverbs, but not all:

**Structures that function as adverbials:**

1. **Adverbs** (form = function):
   - *She spoke **quietly**.*

2. **Prepositional phrases**:
   - *She spoke **in a quiet voice**.*
   - *He arrived **at noon**.*

3. **Noun phrases** (temporal/spatial):
   - *She arrived **yesterday**.*
   - *They walked **two miles**.*

4. **Infinitive phrases**:
   - *She stopped **to rest**.*
   - *I came **to help**.*

5. **Adverb clauses**:
   - *She spoke quietly **because the baby was sleeping**.*
   - ***When he arrived**, the meeting had ended.*

6. **Participial phrases**:
   - ***Running quickly**, she caught the bus.*
   - ***Exhausted**, he collapsed.*

### Why the Distinction Matters

A prepositional phrase like *in the morning* is an adverbial (it modifies the verb) but not an adverb (it's a PP by form). Accurate analysis requires recognizing both form and function.

---

## 10.3 Types of Adverbs

Adverbs are classified by their meaning and the types of elements they modify.

### Manner Adverbs

**Manner adverbs** describe how an action is performed:
- *quickly*, *slowly*, *carefully*, *loudly*, *well*, *badly*
- *She walked **slowly**.*
- *He spoke **clearly**.*

Most manner adverbs end in *-ly* and can be graded:
- *more slowly*, *most carefully*, *less loudly*

### Time Adverbs

**Time adverbs** indicate when something happens:
- *now*, *then*, *today*, *yesterday*, *soon*, *already*, *still*, *yet*
- *I will see you **tomorrow**.*
- *She has **already** left.*

### Frequency Adverbs

**Frequency adverbs** indicate how often something happens:
- *always*, *usually*, *often*, *sometimes*, *rarely*, *never*
- *He **always** arrives early.*
- *They **rarely** complain.*

Frequency adverbs typically appear:
- Before the main verb: *She **often** reads.*
- After *be*: *She is **always** happy.*
- After the first auxiliary: *She has **never** been late.*

### Place Adverbs

**Place adverbs** indicate where something happens:
- *here*, *there*, *everywhere*, *somewhere*, *nowhere*, *away*, *outside*
- *Come **here**.*
- *She looked **everywhere**.*

### Degree Adverbs

**Degree adverbs** indicate intensity or extent:
- *very*, *extremely*, *quite*, *rather*, *somewhat*, *almost*, *completely*
- *a **very** tall building*
- *I **almost** forgot.*

Degree adverbs modify:
- Adjectives: ***extremely** difficult*
- Other adverbs: ***very** quickly*
- Verbs: *I **completely** agree.*

### Sentence Adverbs

**Sentence adverbs** modify entire sentences, expressing the speaker's attitude:
- *unfortunately*, *fortunately*, *clearly*, *obviously*, *apparently*, *frankly*
- ***Unfortunately**, the train was late.*
- ***Frankly**, I don't care.*

These often appear at the beginning of sentences, set off by commas.

### Conjunctive Adverbs

**Conjunctive adverbs** connect ideas between sentences or clauses:
- *however*, *therefore*, *moreover*, *nevertheless*, *consequently*, *meanwhile*
- *She studied hard; **however**, she failed the exam.*
- *The roads were icy. **Therefore**, we stayed home.*

These are often set off by commas or semicolons.

## 10.4 Adverb Phrase Structure

An **adverb phrase (AdvP)** has an adverb as its head, with optional modifiers.

### AdvP Components

```
(Pre-modifiers) + HEAD ADVERB + (Post-modifiers)
```

**Pre-modifiers** (degree adverbs):
- ***very** quickly*
- ***extremely** carefully*
- ***quite** often*

**Post-modifiers** (less common):
- *surprisingly **enough***
- *oddly **enough***
- *fast **enough to win***

### Complex AdvPs

*very much more quickly than expected*
- Pre-modifiers: *very much more*
- Head: *quickly*
- Post-modifier: *than expected*

*far too slowly for my taste*
- Pre-modifiers: *far too*
- Head: *slowly*
- Post-modifier: *for my taste*

## 10.5 Adverb Position and Mobility

One distinctive feature of adverbs is their **mobility**—they can appear in multiple positions in a sentence. However, different types of adverbs prefer different positions.

### Position Types

**Initial position** (beginning of sentence):
- ***Yesterday**, I saw a movie.*
- ***Fortunately**, no one was hurt.*

**Medial position** (within the clause):
- *I **often** see movies.*
- *She has **never** been late.*

**Final position** (end of clause):
- *I saw a movie **yesterday**.*
- *She spoke **quietly**.*

### Position by Adverb Type

| Adverb Type | Preferred Position | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Manner | Final | *She sings **beautifully**.* |
| Time | Initial or Final | ***Tomorrow** I'll go.* / *I'll go **tomorrow**.* |
| Frequency | Medial | *She **often** reads.* |
| Place | Final | *Put it **here**.* |
| Degree | Before modified word | *a **very** good book* |
| Sentence | Initial | ***Unfortunately**, I can't.* |

### Meaning Changes with Position

Sometimes position affects meaning or emphasis:

*She slowly opened the door.* (emphasizes manner)
*Slowly, she opened the door.* (emphasizes the slow pace)

*He only eats vegetables.* (vegetables and nothing else)
*He eats only vegetables.* (same, but more emphatic)
*Only he eats vegetables.* (no one else eats them)

### Adverb Placement Rules

**Frequency adverbs** go:
- Before main verb: *She **always** helps.*
- After *be*: *He is **never** late.*
- After first auxiliary: *They have **often** wondered.*

**Manner adverbs** typically go:
- After the verb: *She sang **beautifully**.*
- After the object: *She sang the song **beautifully**.*

Not between verb and object:
- ~~*She sang beautifully the song.*~~ ✗

## 10.6 Adverbials: Prepositional Phrases

Prepositional phrases are among the most common adverbials. They modify verbs, adjectives, and sentences.

### PP as Adverbial

**Modifying verbs:**
- *She arrived **at noon**.* (time)
- *He works **in the office**.* (place)
- *She spoke **with confidence**.* (manner)
- *They left **because of the weather**.* (reason)

**Modifying adjectives:**
- *happy **with the results***
- *good **at math***
- *afraid **of spiders***

**Modifying sentences:**
- ***In the morning**, we will leave.*
- ***To my surprise**, she agreed.*

### Adverbial vs. Adjectival PPs

Remember: The same PP form can have different functions.

**Adjectival** (modifies noun):
- *the man **in the hat*** (which man?)

**Adverbial** (modifies verb):
- *He waited **in the hall**.* (where?)

To distinguish: Ask what the PP modifies. If it modifies a noun, it's adjectival. If it modifies a verb or sentence, it's adverbial.

---

## 10.7 Form vs. Function: Adjectives as Adverbs

Some adjectives function as adverbs without changing form:

**Fast, hard, late, early, well**

*She runs **fast**.* (adverb—modifies verb)
*She is a **fast** runner.* (adjective—modifies noun)

*He works **hard**.* (adverb—modifies verb)
*This is **hard** work.* (adjective—modifies noun)

These are sometimes called "flat adverbs."

**Note:** Some have both flat and *-ly* forms with different meanings:
- *He arrived **late**.* (at a late time)
- *She has been sick **lately**.* (recently)
- *He can jump **high**.* (to a great height)
- *He is **highly** skilled.* (very)

## Form and Function Tests

### Identifying Adverbs and Adverbials

| Test | Adverbs | Adverbials |
|------|---------|------------|
| Ends in *-ly* | Often | Varies |
| Can modify verbs | Yes | Yes (definition) |
| Can modify adjectives | Yes | Some |
| Between Det and N | No | No |
| Movable in sentence | Often | Often |

### Analysis Process

1. **Find elements modifying verbs/adjectives/adverbs/sentences**
2. **Determine form**: Is it an adverb, PP, NP, clause, or phrase?
3. **Confirm function**: Is it modifying appropriately (adverbial)?
4. **Classify type**: Manner, time, place, degree, sentence, etc.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Adverb Identification

Use morphological and syntactic tests to determine if each underlined word is an adverb.

1. *She spoke **softly** to the child.*
2. *The **soft** music relaxed me.*
3. *He is **very** talented.*
4. *She **often** visits her grandmother.*
5. *That was a **really** good movie.*

### Exercise 2: Form vs. Function

For each underlined element, identify: (a) form, (b) function (adverbial or not).

1. *She arrived **yesterday**.*
2. *He spoke **with confidence**.*
3. *I waited **patiently**.*
4. ***When the bell rang**, we left.*
5. *She ran **fast**.*

### Exercise 3: Adverb Types

Classify each underlined adverb (manner, time, frequency, place, degree, sentence, conjunctive).

1. *She sings **beautifully**.*
2. *I **always** eat breakfast.*
3. ***Unfortunately**, we lost.*
4. *Come **here**.*
5. *The test was **extremely** difficult.*
6. *We arrived **late**.*
7. ***However**, I disagree.*

### Exercise 4: Adverb Position

Rewrite each sentence, placing the adverb in different acceptable positions. Note any meaning changes.

1. *She finished her homework.* (quickly)
2. *He is on time.* (always)
3. *I have been to Paris.* (never)
4. *The show starts.* (tomorrow)

### Exercise 5: Adverbial or Adjectival?

Identify whether each underlined PP functions as an adjectival (modifies noun) or adverbial (modifies verb/sentence).

1. *The book **on the table** is mine.*
2. *She put the book **on the table**.*
3. *The man **in the blue coat** left.*
4. *He waited **in the lobby**.*
5. ***In the morning**, we exercise.*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Adverb Mobility

Take these base sentences and show how the adverb can move to different positions. Note any positions that don't work.

1. *She has visited Paris.* (never)
2. *The child ate the cookie.* (quickly)
3. *We will discuss this issue.* (tomorrow)

### Activity 2: Adverbial Hunt

Find five sentences with adverbials in a news article. For each:
- Identify the adverbial
- Identify its form (adverb, PP, clause, etc.)
- Classify its type (manner, time, place, etc.)

### Activity 3: Flat Adverbs

For each of these flat adverbs, write two sentences: one where it's an adjective and one where it's an adverb.

1. *fast*
2. *hard*
3. *early*
4. *straight*
5. *wrong*

Example:
- Adjective: *That's a **hard** problem.*
- Adverb: *She works **hard**.*

## Chapter Summary

- **Adverbs** are identified through morphological tests (*-ly* suffix, comparative forms) and syntactic tests (modifies verbs/adjectives/adverbs/sentences, cannot appear between determiner and noun).
- **Adverbial** is a function—any structure that modifies a verb, adjective, adverb, or sentence. Adverbs are adverbials, but so are PPs, NPs, and clauses.
- Adverbs are classified by meaning: **manner**, **time**, **frequency**, **place**, **degree**, **sentence**, **conjunctive**.
- **Adverb phrases** have an adverb as head with optional degree modifiers.
- Adverbs show **mobility**—they can appear in different positions—but different types have preferred positions.
- **Prepositional phrases** commonly function as adverbials, modifying verbs and sentences.
- Some words (like *fast*, *hard*) function as adverbs without *-ly* (**flat adverbs**).
