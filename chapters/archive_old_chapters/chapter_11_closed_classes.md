## 11.1 Open vs. Closed Classes

In Chapter 5, we introduced the distinction between **open classes** and **closed classes**. This distinction is fundamental to understanding how English grammar works.

### Open Classes

**Open classes** accept new members freely. English speakers regularly create new nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs:

- **Nouns**: *selfie*, *cryptocurrency*, *podcast*, *meme*
- **Verbs**: *google*, *tweet*, *zoom*, *ghost* (meaning to ignore)
- **Adjectives**: *viral*, *basic*, *woke*, *sus*
- **Adverbs**: *lowkey*, *highkey*, *literally* (in its emphatic sense)

These classes contain thousands of members, and the list grows constantly. New open-class words are coined to name new concepts, actions, and qualities.

### Closed Classes

**Closed classes** resist new members. They contain a fixed (or nearly fixed) inventory of words that rarely changes:

- **Prepositions**: *in*, *on*, *at*, *to*, *from*, *with*...
- **Determiners**: *the*, *a*, *this*, *my*, *every*, *some*...
- **Pronouns**: *I*, *you*, *he*, *she*, *it*, *we*, *they*...
- **Conjunctions**: *and*, *but*, *or*, *if*, *because*, *although*...
- **Auxiliaries**: *be*, *have*, *do*, *can*, *will*, *might*...

When did English last add a new preposition? A new pronoun? These classes have been essentially stable for centuries. Even the gradual acceptance of singular *they* represents an expansion of function, not a new word.

### Why the Difference Matters

Closed-class words differ from open-class words in several important ways:

**Function vs. content**: Open-class words carry most of the *content* meaning—the ideas, actions, and qualities that sentences are about. Closed-class words carry *grammatical* meaning—they show relationships, specify reference, and connect elements.

Compare:
- Open: *student*, *brilliantly*, *discovered*, *ancient* (content-rich)
- Closed: *the*, *in*, *she*, *and*, *have* (grammatically functional)

**Memorization vs. productivity**: Because closed classes are small, speakers can memorize every member. Open classes are too large for complete memorization; instead, speakers learn productive patterns for creating new words.

**Processing**: Psycholinguistic research suggests that open-class and closed-class words are processed differently in the brain. Closed-class words are more likely to be retrieved as whole units rather than assembled from parts.

This chapter focuses on three important closed classes: prepositions, determiners, and pronouns. Each plays a distinctive role in English grammar.

## 11.2 Prepositions and Prepositional Phrases

**Prepositions** are closed-class words that show relationships—typically spatial, temporal, or logical—between elements in a sentence. They take noun phrase complements and together form **prepositional phrases (PPs)**.

### Identifying Prepositions

A traditional mnemonic says prepositions describe "anywhere a cat can be": *in* the box, *on* the table, *under* the chair, *beside* the sofa, *near* the window, *through* the door...

But prepositions express much more than spatial relationships. Consider:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Spatial** | *in*, *on*, *at*, *above*, *below*, *under*, *over*, *between*, *among*, *through*, *across*, *behind*, *beside*, *near*, *toward* |
| **Temporal** | *before*, *after*, *during*, *since*, *until*, *throughout* |
| **Logical/Abstract** | *of*, *for*, *with*, *by*, *about*, *without*, *despite*, *concerning*, *regarding* |

**Complex prepositions** are multi-word units that function as single prepositions:
- *because of*, *instead of*, *in spite of*
- *according to*, *due to*, *prior to*
- *in front of*, *on top of*, *in addition to*

### Prepositional Phrase Structure

A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition plus its **object** (typically an NP):

![Simple prepositional phrase](../assets/diagrams/ch11_simple_pp.svg)

**Examples:**

| Preposition | Object NP | Meaning |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| in | the morning | temporal |
| on | the tall wooden table | spatial |
| to | my best friend | direction/recipient |
| from | the old house on the corner | source |
| about | the recent controversy | topic |

The object of the preposition can be:
- A simple noun: *in **town***
- A complex NP: *in **the busy downtown area***
- A pronoun: *with **her*** (object form required)
- A gerund: *after **leaving***, *without **knowing***

### PP Functions: Adjectival vs. Adverbial

Prepositional phrases function as modifiers—either **adjectival** (modifying nouns) or **adverbial** (modifying verbs, adjectives, or sentences).

**Adjectival PPs** modify nouns, answering "which one?" or "what kind?":
- *the man **in the hat*** (which man?)
- *a book **about grammar*** (what kind?)
- *the house **on the corner*** (which house?)

Adjectival PPs follow the noun they modify and remain part of the NP:

![Adjectival PP (the man in the hat)](../assets/diagrams/ch11_adjectival_pp.svg)

**Adverbial PPs** modify verbs (or whole sentences), providing information about time, place, manner, reason, etc.:
- *She arrived **at noon**.* (when?)
- *He works **in the office**.* (where?)
- *They spoke **with enthusiasm**.* (how?)
- *We left **because of the weather**.* (why?)

Adverbial PPs attach to the VP, not to any particular noun:

![Adverbial PP (She waited in the lobby)](../assets/diagrams/ch11_adverbial_pp.svg)

### Distinguishing the Two Functions

The key question: **What does the PP modify?**

**Test 1: What question does it answer?**
- "Which man?" → adjectival (*the man in the hat*)
- "Where/when/how?" → adverbial (*waited in the hall*)

**Test 2: Can it move?**
- Adverbial PPs can often move to sentence-initial position: *In the morning, we left.*
- Adjectival PPs typically cannot move: *~~In the hat, the man waved.~~*

**Test 3: Can the noun stand alone?**
- If the noun makes sense without the PP (even with changed meaning), the PP is adjectival: *The man waved.* (works, but which man?)
- If removing the PP from the VP changes the event, it's adverbial

### Ambiguous Attachment

Some sentences are ambiguous between adjectival and adverbial readings:

*She saw the man with binoculars.*

- **Adjectival**: "the man who had binoculars" (PP modifies *man*)
- **Adverbial**: "she used binoculars to see him" (PP modifies *saw*)

In speech, context usually resolves such ambiguity. In writing, you may need to restructure to be clear.

### Diagramming PPs

**Adjectival PP** (modifies noun):

![Adjectival PP (the man in the hat)](../assets/diagrams/ch11_adjectival_pp.svg)

**Adverbial PP** (modifies verb):

![Adverbial PP (She waited in the lobby)](../assets/diagrams/ch11_adverbial_pp.svg)

## 11.3 Determiners

**Determiners** introduce noun phrases and help specify reference—they help listeners identify which entity(s) the speaker is talking about.

### What Determiners Do

When you hear "I saw a dog," the determiner *a* signals that the dog is being introduced for the first time (indefinite reference). When you hear "I saw the dog," *the* signals that you should already know which dog (definite reference).

Determiners answer questions like:
- Which one? (*the*, *this*, *that*)
- How many? (*three*, *several*, *many*)
- Whose? (*my*, *the professor's*)
- Which subset? (*some*, *any*, *every*, *no*)

### Types of Determiners

**Articles** are the most common determiners:
- **Definite article** (*the*): The referent is identifiable to the listener
- **Indefinite articles** (*a*, *an*): The referent is being introduced or is unspecified

**Demonstratives** point to specific entities:
- **Near**: *this*, *these* (close to speaker)
- **Far**: *that*, *those* (farther from speaker)

**Possessives** indicate ownership or relationship:
- **Pronoun forms**: *my*, *your*, *his*, *her*, *its*, *our*, *their*
- **Noun + 's**: *John's*, *the dog's*, *my sister's*

**Quantifiers** indicate amount or quantity:
- **Universal**: *all*, *every*, *each*, *both*
- **Existential**: *some*, *any*, *no*
- **Degree**: *many*, *much*, *few*, *little*, *several*, *enough*

**Numbers**:
- **Cardinal**: *one*, *two*, *three*...
- **Ordinal**: *first*, *second*, *third*...

**Interrogative/Relative**: *which*, *what*, *whose*

### Determiner Position

Determiners occupy a specific position in the NP—they come first, before any adjectives:

```
Det + (Adj) + N

the     big    dog
my      old    friend
some    fresh  bread
```

**Important**: Most determiners are mutually exclusive—you can't stack them:
- ~~*the my book*~~
- ~~*this the student*~~
- ~~*a every dog*~~

However, some combinations are allowed:
- *all the students* (quantifier + article)
- *both my parents* (quantifier + possessive)
- *the first three chapters* (article + ordinal + cardinal)

### Determiners vs. Adjectives

Determiners and adjectives both appear before nouns, but they differ:

| Feature | Determiners | Adjectives |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Class | Closed | Open |
| Position | First (before Adj) | After Det, before N |
| Function | Specify reference | Describe qualities |
| Stacking | Limited combinations | Multiple allowed |
| Obligatoriness | Often required | Always optional |

Compare:
- *The* book is required for singular count nouns: ~~*Book is on table.*~~
- *Interesting* is optional: *The book is on the table.*

### Count vs. Mass Nouns and Determiners

Determiner choice interacts with whether a noun is **count** (discrete entities) or **mass** (undifferentiated substance):

| Determiner | Count (singular) | Count (plural) | Mass |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|------|
| *a/an* | ✓ *a book* | ✗ | ✗ |
| *the* | ✓ *the book* | ✓ *the books* | ✓ *the water* |
| *this/that* | ✓ *this book* | ✗ | ✓ *this water* |
| *these/those* | ✗ | ✓ *these books* | ✗ |
| *some* | ✗ | ✓ *some books* | ✓ *some water* |
| *many* | ✗ | ✓ *many books* | ✗ |
| *much* | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ *much water* |

These patterns are systematic—not arbitrary—and native speakers follow them automatically.

### Diagramming Determiners

Determiners occupy a specific position in the NP tree:

![NP with determiner and adjective](../assets/diagrams/ch11_np_with_det.svg)

Possessive NPs function as determiners:

![Possessive NP as determiner](../assets/diagrams/ch11_possessive_np.svg)

---

## 11.4 Pronouns

**Pronouns** replace noun phrases. They allow speakers to refer to entities without repeating full NPs—crucial for efficient communication.

### Why Pronouns Exist

Imagine language without pronouns:

*Maria said that Maria wanted Maria's book back, but John told Maria that John had already returned Maria's book to Maria's office, and Maria should check Maria's desk.*

Now with pronouns:

*Maria said that she wanted her book back, but John told her that he had already returned it to her office, and she should check her desk.*

Pronouns reduce redundancy and improve processing. But they require listeners to track what each pronoun refers to—its **antecedent**.

### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are the most common type. They vary for:

**Person**: 1st (speaker), 2nd (addressee), 3rd (other)
**Number**: singular vs. plural
**Case**: subject vs. object vs. possessive
**Gender** (3rd person singular): masculine, feminine, neuter

| Person | Subject | Object | Possessive Det | Possessive Pro |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| 1st sg | I | me | my | mine |
| 2nd sg | you | you | your | yours |
| 3rd sg masc | he | him | his | his |
| 3rd sg fem | she | her | her | hers |
| 3rd sg neut | it | it | its | (its) |
| 1st pl | we | us | our | ours |
| 2nd pl | you | you | your | yours |
| 3rd pl | they | them | their | theirs |

**Case matters**: Use subject forms for subjects, object forms for objects:
- Subject: ***She** left.* (not ~~*Her left.*~~)
- Object: *I saw **her**.* (not ~~*I saw she.*~~)
- After preposition: *with **me*** (not ~~*with I*~~)

**Singular "they"**: Increasingly accepted for indefinite reference and for people who don't identify as he or she:
- *Someone left **their** book.* (indefinite)
- *Alex said **they** would come.* (nonbinary reference)

### Reflexive Pronouns

Reflexive pronouns end in *-self* (singular) or *-selves* (plural):

*myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves*

They're used when the object refers to the same entity as the subject:
- *She hurt **herself**.* (she = herself)
- *They saw **themselves** in the mirror.*

Reflexives cannot be subjects and cannot appear without an antecedent in the same clause:
- ~~***Himself** arrived.*~~
- ~~*I saw **herself**.*~~ (no matching antecedent)

### Demonstrative Pronouns

*This*, *that*, *these*, *those* can function as pronouns (standing alone) or determiners (with a noun):

- **Pronoun**: ***This** is interesting.* ***Those** are mine.*
- **Determiner**: ***This book** is interesting.* ***Those books** are mine.*

As pronouns, demonstratives typically refer to things just mentioned or about to be mentioned, or things physically present.

### Interrogative Pronouns

Question words that stand for unknown NPs:

- *Who/whom* (people): ***Who** called?* *I saw **whom**?*
- *What* (things): ***What** happened?* *I saw **what**?*
- *Which* (selective): ***Which** do you want?*
- *Whose* (possession): ***Whose** is this?*

**Who vs. whom**: Traditional grammar requires *whom* as object (*Whom did you see?*), but in modern English, *who* is common in all positions except after prepositions (*To whom* is still preferred over *To who*).

### Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses:

- *who/whom/whose* (people): *the man **who** arrived*
- *which* (things): *the book **which** I read*
- *that* (people or things): *the person **that** called*, *the book **that** I read*

The relative pronoun connects the clause to its antecedent and plays a grammatical role within the clause:

*The student **who** won the prize...*
- *who* = subject of *won*

*The book **that** I read...*
- *that* = object of *read*

### Indefinite Pronouns

Pronouns that refer to unspecified entities:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Universal** | *everyone*, *everybody*, *everything*, *all*, *each*, *both* |
| **Existential** | *someone*, *somebody*, *something*, *some*, *any* |
| **Negative** | *no one*, *nobody*, *nothing*, *none* |

Many indefinites are grammatically singular even when semantically plural:
- *Everyone **is** here.* (not ~~*Everyone are*~~)
- *Each of the students **has** arrived.*

### Diagramming Pronouns

Pronouns occupy NP positions, typically labeled Pro:

## 11.5 Comparing the Three Classes

These three closed classes share important properties but differ in function:

### Shared Properties

| Property | Prepositions | Determiners | Pronouns |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Closed class | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Limited membership | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Grammatical function | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| High frequency | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### Distinctive Functions

| Class | Primary Function |
|-------|------------------|
| **Prepositions** | Show relationships between NPs and other elements |
| **Determiners** | Specify reference within NPs |
| **Pronouns** | Replace entire NPs |

### How They Work Together

In a sentence like *She gave the book to him*, all three classes appear:
- *She* (pronoun) — replaces a full NP as subject
- *the* (determiner) — specifies which book
- *to* (preposition) — shows relationship (recipient)
- *him* (pronoun) — replaces a full NP as object of preposition

Each closed-class word does minimal semantic work but essential grammatical work—they're the glue that holds sentences together.

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: PP Attachment Ambiguity

Each sentence is ambiguous. Identify both meanings and explain what structural difference creates the ambiguity.

1. *She photographed the girl with the camera.*
2. *He saw the bird on the roof with his telescope.*
3. *The professor discussed the problem with the student.*

### Activity 2: Determiner Patterns

Complete the table by marking whether each determiner can occur with each noun type:

| Determiner | Count Singular | Count Plural | Mass |
|------------|---------------|--------------|------|
| *a* | | | |
| *the* | | | |
| *this* | | | |
| *these* | | | |
| *some* | | | |
| *every* | | | |
| *many* | | | |
| *much* | | | |

### Activity 3: Pronoun Reference

In each sentence, identify the antecedent of each pronoun.

1. *Maria told John that she had seen his car.*
2. *When the students arrived, they found their classroom locked.*
3. *The book that I bought was expensive, but it was worth it.*
4. *Everyone should bring their own lunch.*

### Activity 4: Closed Class Analysis

Choose a short paragraph from a published source. Identify every:
- Preposition (and its object)
- Determiner (and the NP it introduces)
- Pronoun (and its antecedent if recoverable)

What percentage of words are closed-class words? What does this suggest about their frequency?

## Chapter Summary

- **Closed classes** have fixed membership and serve primarily grammatical functions.
- **Prepositions** head prepositional phrases that function as adjectival or adverbial modifiers.
- **Determiners** introduce noun phrases and specify reference (which, whose, how many).
- **Pronouns** replace noun phrases, allowing efficient reference without repetition.
- These three classes are among the most frequent words in English despite their limited membership.
- Understanding closed classes helps explain why English sentences are structured the way they are.
