## 9.1 Identifying Adjectives

Adjectives are an open-class part of speech that typically modify nouns. As with other word classes, we identify adjectives through formal and functional tests.

### Morphological Tests (Form)

**Test 1: Comparative and superlative forms**

Most adjectives can be graded—they have comparative and superlative forms:
- *tall* → *taller* → *tallest*
- *happy* → *happier* → *happiest*
- *beautiful* → *more beautiful* → *most beautiful*

**Test 2: Adding -ish**

Many adjectives can take the suffix *-ish* (meaning "somewhat"):
- *tall* → *tallish*
- *red* → *reddish*
- *young* → *youngish*
- *warm* → *warmish*

**Test 3: Conversion to adverb with -ly**

Many adjectives can become adverbs by adding *-ly*:
- *happy* → *happily*
- *quick* → *quickly*
- *sad* → *sadly*
- *careful* → *carefully*

### Syntactic Tests (Function)

**Test 1: Attributive position**

Adjectives can appear between a determiner and a noun:
- *the **tall** man*
- *a **happy** child*
- *the **interesting** book*

**Test 2: Predicative position**

Adjectives can follow a linking verb (*be*, *seem*, *appear*, *become*):
- *The man is **tall**.*
- *She seems **happy**.*
- *The book appears **interesting**.*

**Test 3: Modification by very**

Adjectives can be modified by degree adverbs like *very*:
- *very tall*
- *extremely happy*
- *quite interesting*

**Test 4: Coordination with and**

Adjectives can be coordinated with other adjectives:
- *tall and handsome*
- *happy and content*
- *old and worn*

### Practice: Applying the Tests

Is *magnificent* an adjective?

**Morphological tests:**
- Comparative: *more magnificent* ✓
- Superlative: *most magnificent* ✓
- Can add *-ish*: *magnificentish* (marginal but possible) ✓
- Adverb form: *magnificently* ✓

**Syntactic tests:**
- Attributive: *a magnificent view* ✓
- Predicative: *The view is magnificent* ✓
- With *very*: *very magnificent* ✓

Result: *magnificent* is definitely an adjective.

## 9.2 Adjectives vs. Adjectivals: Form and Function

The distinction between **adjective** (form) and **adjectival** (function) is crucial for understanding how grammar works.

### Adjective as Form

An **adjective** is a part of speech—a word that has adjective morphology and typically modifies nouns.

### Adjectival as Function

An **adjectival** is any word or structure that functions to modify a noun. Many adjectivals are adjectives, but not all:

**Structures that function as adjectivals:**

1. **Adjectives** (form = function):
   - *the **tall** man*

2. **Nouns** (form ≠ function):
   - *the **coffee** table*
   - *the **government** report*

3. **Prepositional phrases**:
   - *the man **in the hat***
   - *a book **about grammar***

4. **Participial phrases**:
   - *the **running** water*
   - *the **broken** window*

5. **Relative clauses**:
   - *the book **that I read***
   - *the student **who works hard***

6. **Infinitive phrases**:
   - *the decision **to leave***
   - *something **to eat***

### Why the Distinction Matters

Understanding form vs. function helps you:
- Accurately analyze sentence structure
- Recognize the flexibility of English grammar
- See patterns across different constructions
- Avoid confusion in grammatical labeling

## 9.3 Types of Adjectives

### Gradable vs. Non-Gradable

**Gradable adjectives** express qualities that can vary in degree:
- *tall/taller/tallest*
- *interesting/more interesting/most interesting*
- Can be modified by degree words: *very tall*, *somewhat interesting*

**Non-gradable adjectives** express absolute qualities:
- *dead* (not *deader*—you're either dead or not)
- *unique* (traditionally not *more unique*)
- *wooden*, *chemical*, *weekly*

In practice, many "non-gradable" adjectives get graded in informal speech (*very unique*, *more perfect*), but prescriptive style guides often discourage this.

### Descriptive vs. Classifying

**Descriptive adjectives** describe qualities:
- *a beautiful painting*
- *a tall building*
- *a happy child*

**Classifying adjectives** categorize or identify:
- *a chemical reaction* (type of reaction)
- *a wooden table* (material)
- *a weekly meeting* (frequency)

Classifying adjectives:
- Cannot be graded: ~~*very chemical*~~
- Cannot be predicative: ~~*The reaction is chemical*~~ (awkward)
- Must come closer to the noun: *a beautiful old wooden table*

### Attributive-Only vs. Predicative-Only

Most adjectives can appear in both positions, but some are restricted:

**Attributive-only** (before noun only):
- *the **main** problem* (not ~~*The problem is main*~~)
- *the **former** president* (not ~~*The president is former*~~)
- *the **utter** disaster* (not ~~*The disaster is utter*~~)

**Predicative-only** (after linking verb only):
- *The child is **asleep*** (not ~~*the asleep child*~~)
- *She is **afraid*** (not ~~*an afraid girl*~~)
- *He is **alive*** (not ~~*an alive person*~~—but *a living person*)

## 9.4 Adjective Order

When multiple adjectives modify a noun, they appear in a specific order. Native speakers follow this order intuitively:

### The Adjective Order

**Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Opinion | beautiful, nice, ugly, wonderful |
| Size | big, small, tall, tiny |
| Age | old, new, young, ancient |
| Shape | round, square, flat, rectangular |
| Color | red, blue, green, brown |
| Origin | Italian, French, American, eastern |
| Material | wooden, metal, plastic, leather |
| Purpose | writing (desk), sleeping (bag) |

### Examples

- *a **beautiful big old** house* ✓
- *a **big beautiful old** house* ✗

- *a **lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling** knife* ✓
- *a **green rectangular French old little lovely silver whittling** knife* ✗

- *the **big red** ball* ✓
- *the **red big** ball* ✗

### Why This Order?

Adjectives that are more inherent or essential to the noun's identity come closer to the noun:
- Material and purpose are more defining than opinion
- Color is more defining than size
- The most subjective qualities (opinion) are farthest from the noun

## 9.5 Adjective Phrase Structure

An **adjective phrase (AdjP)** has an adjective as its head, with optional modifiers and complements.

### AdjP Components

```
(Pre-modifiers) + HEAD ADJECTIVE + (Post-modifiers/Complements)
```

**Pre-modifiers** (degree adverbs):
- ***very** happy*
- ***extremely** tall*
- ***quite** interesting*
- ***rather** cold*

**Post-modifiers/Complements**:
- *happy **about the news***
- *afraid **of spiders***
- *eager **to help***
- *similar **to mine***

### Complex AdjPs

Adjective phrases can be quite elaborate:

*very proud of her students*
- Pre-modifier: *very*
- Head: *proud*
- Complement: *of her students* (PP)

*extremely difficult to understand*
- Pre-modifier: *extremely*
- Head: *difficult*
- Complement: *to understand* (infinitive phrase)

### AdjP Positions

**Attributive position** (before noun):
- *a **very tall** man*
- *the **extremely interesting** book*

Simple AdjPs work in attributive position, but complex ones often don't:
- *a **proud** teacher* ✓
- ~~*a **proud of her students** teacher*~~ ✗
- *a teacher **proud of her students*** ✓ (post-nominal)

**Predicative position** (after linking verb):
- *The man is **very tall**.*
- *She seems **afraid of spiders**.*

## 9.6 Adjectivals: Other Structures Modifying Nouns

### Nouns as Adjectivals

Nouns often modify other nouns in English:
- ***coffee** table* (table for coffee)
- ***government** policy* (policy by government)
- ***brick** wall* (wall made of brick)
- ***history** teacher* (teacher of history)

These are different from adjectives:
- Not gradable: ~~*very coffee table*~~
- Not predicative: ~~*The table is coffee*~~

### Prepositional Phrases as Adjectivals

PPs commonly modify nouns:
- *the man **in the hat***
- *a book **about grammar***
- *the house **on the corner***

These PPs are adjectivals (they modify nouns), but they are not adjectives (they are PPs by form).

### Participial Adjectives

Present and past participles often function as adjectives:

**Present participle (-ing):**
- *the **running** water*
- *an **interesting** book*
- *a **boring** lecture*

**Past participle (-ed/-en):**
- *a **broken** window*
- *the **written** word*
- *a **tired** student*

**Test:** Can they be graded?
- *very interesting* ✓ → functions as adjective
- *very broken* ✓ → functions as adjective

Some participles retain more verbal characteristics:
- *the **sleeping** baby* (adjective—can say *very sleepy*)
- *the baby **sleeping in the crib*** (participial phrase—more verbal)

### Relative Clauses as Adjectivals

Relative clauses modify nouns:
- *the book **that I read***
- *students **who work hard***
- *the house **where I grew up***

These are adjectivals by function (they modify nouns) but clauses by form.

## Form and Function Tests

### Quick Reference: Identifying Adjectives and Adjectivals

| Test | Adjectives | Adjectivals |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Gradable | Usually yes | Varies |
| Follows determiner | Yes | Varies |
| After linking verb | Usually yes | No (for NAs, PPs) |
| Modified by *very* | Yes | No (for NAs, PPs) |
| Modifies noun | Yes | Yes (definition) |

### Analysis Process

1. **Identify elements modifying nouns**
2. **Determine form**: Is it an adjective, noun, PP, participle, or clause?
3. **Confirm function**: Is it modifying a noun (adjectival)?
4. **Note any mismatches**: Form ≠ function?

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Adjective Identification

Use morphological and syntactic tests to determine if each underlined word is an adjective.

1. *She seems **happy** today.*
2. *The **coffee** is cold.*
3. *They bought a **wooden** table.*
4. *The **tired** students went home.*
5. *His behavior was **strange**.*

### Exercise 2: Form vs. Function

For each underlined element, identify: (a) form (adjective, noun, PP, participle, clause), (b) function (adjectival or not).

1. *the **tall** man*
2. *the **government** building*
3. *the man **in the hat***
4. *the **running** water*
5. *the book **that I bought***

### Exercise 3: Adjective Order

Arrange the adjectives in the correct order:

1. *a house (beautiful, old, big)*
2. *a table (wooden, round, small)*
3. *a car (red, sports, new, Italian)*
4. *a knife (old, carving, sharp)*

### Exercise 4: AdjP Structure

Identify the components of each adjective phrase (pre-modifier, head, complement).

1. *very proud of her work*
2. *extremely difficult to solve*
3. *quite similar to mine*
4. *rather unhappy about the decision*

### Exercise 5: Attributive or Predicative?

Identify whether each adjective can appear in attributive position (A), predicative position (P), or both (B).

1. *asleep*
2. *beautiful*
3. *main*
4. *happy*
5. *afraid*
6. *wooden*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Adjective Stacking

Create noun phrases with multiple adjectives in correct order:

1. Start with *house* and add adjectives for size, age, color, and origin.
2. Start with *car* and add adjectives for opinion, size, age, and color.
3. Start with *dog* and add adjectives for size, age, color, and origin.

### Activity 2: Adjectival Hunt

Find five sentences in a news article or textbook that contain adjectivals. For each:
- Identify the adjectival
- Identify its form (adjective, PP, participle, clause)
- Identify the noun it modifies

### Activity 3: Participial Adjectives

For each verb, create both a present participial adjective and a past participial adjective. Use each in a sentence.

1. *bore*
2. *excite*
3. *frighten*
4. *interest*
5. *confuse*

Example:
- *bore* → *boring* (The lecture was boring.) / *bored* (The bored students fell asleep.)

## Chapter Summary

- **Adjectives** are identified through morphological tests (comparative forms, *-ish*, *-ly* conversion) and syntactic tests (attributive position, predicative position, modified by *very*).
- **Adjectival** is a function—any structure that modifies a noun. Adjectives are adjectivals, but so are nouns, PPs, participles, and relative clauses.
- Adjectives can be **gradable/non-gradable**, **descriptive/classifying**, and **attributive-only/predicative-only**.
- Multiple adjectives follow a specific **order**: opinion → size → age → shape → color → origin → material → purpose.
- **Adjective phrases** have an adjective as head with optional pre-modifiers (degree adverbs) and complements (PPs, infinitives).
- **Participial adjectives** (*-ing*, *-ed*) come from verbs but function as adjectives.
