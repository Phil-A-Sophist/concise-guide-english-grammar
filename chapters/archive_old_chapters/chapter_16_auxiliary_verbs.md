## 16.1 What Are Auxiliary Verbs?

**Auxiliary verbs** (also called helping verbs) combine with main verbs to create complex verb phrases. They add grammatical information about tense, aspect, voice, and modality.

### Auxiliary vs. Main Verb

**Main verb** (lexical verb): Carries the primary meaning
**Auxiliary verb**: Adds grammatical information

*She **has eaten** dinner.*
- Auxiliary: *has* (adds perfect aspect)
- Main verb: *eaten* (the action)

*The book **was written** by Maria.*
- Auxiliary: *was* (adds passive voice)
- Main verb: *written* (the action)

### Types of Auxiliaries

1. **Primary auxiliaries**: *be*, *have*, *do*
2. **Modal auxiliaries**: *can*, *could*, *will*, *would*, *shall*, *should*, *may*, *might*, *must*

---

## 16.2 Primary Auxiliary: Be

*Be* has multiple functions as an auxiliary.

### Forms of Be

| Present | Past | Participles |
|---------|------|-------------|
| am, is, are | was, were | been, being |

### Functions

**Progressive aspect** (be + -ing):
- *She **is reading**.*
- *They **were studying**.*
- *He **has been working**.*

**Passive voice** (be + past participle):
- *The book **was written** by Maria.*
- *The house **is being built**.*
- *The work **will be completed**.*

### Be as Main Verb

*Be* can also be a main verb (copular/linking):
- *She **is** a teacher.* (main verb—links subject to complement)

**Distinguishing:**
- Followed by -ing form = auxiliary (*She **is reading**.*)
- Followed by past participle = auxiliary passive (*It **was done**.*)
- Followed by NP, AdjP, PP = main verb (*She **is** happy.*)

---

## 16.3 Primary Auxiliary: Have

*Have* forms the perfect aspect.

### Forms of Have

| Present | Past | Participle |
|---------|------|------------|
| have, has | had | had |

### Functions

**Perfect aspect** (have + past participle):
- *She **has finished** the work.* (present perfect)
- *They **had left** before I arrived.* (past perfect)
- *By then, I **will have completed** it.* (future perfect)

### Have as Main Verb

*Have* is also a main verb meaning "possess":
- *She **has** two cars.* (main verb)

**Distinguishing:**
- Followed by past participle = auxiliary (*She **has finished**.*)
- Followed by NP = main verb (*She **has** a car.*)

### Have in American vs. British English

In British English, *have* (possession) can act like an auxiliary:
- British: *Have you a car?* / *I haven't a car.*
- American: *Do you have a car?* / *I don't have a car.*

---

## 16.4 Primary Auxiliary: Do

*Do* has special functions as an auxiliary.

### Forms of Do

| Present | Past |
|---------|------|
| do, does | did |

### Functions

**Questions** (do-support):
- ***Do** you like coffee?*
- ***Does** she work here?*
- ***Did** they finish?*

**Negation** (do + not):
- *I **do not** (don't) like coffee.*
- *She **does not** (doesn't) work here.*
- *They **did not** (didn't) finish.*

**Emphasis** (emphatic do):
- *I **do** like coffee!*
- *She **does** work hard!*
- *They **did** finish!*

**Tag questions**:
- *You like coffee, **don't** you?*
- *She works here, **doesn't** she?*

### Dummy Do

*Do* is called "dummy" or "supporting" *do* because it carries tense but adds no meaning. It's required when no other auxiliary is present.

**Compare:**
- *She **can** swim.* → *Can she swim?* (no *do* needed)
- *She **swims** well.* → ***Does** she swim well?* (*do* required)

---

## 16.5 Modal Auxiliaries

**Modal verbs** express necessity, possibility, ability, permission, and related meanings.

### The Nine Core Modals

| Modal | Common Meanings |
|-------|-----------------|
| **can** | ability, permission, possibility |
| **could** | past ability, possibility, polite request |
| **will** | future, willingness, prediction |
| **would** | conditional, polite request, past habit |
| **shall** | future (formal), suggestion (British) |
| **should** | advice, expectation, probability |
| **may** | permission, possibility |
| **might** | possibility (less certain) |
| **must** | necessity, logical conclusion |

### Characteristics of Modals

**No -s form:**
- *She **can** swim.* (not ~~*cans*~~)

**No infinitive or participles:**
- ~~*to can*~~, ~~*canning*~~, ~~*canned*~~

**Followed by base form:**
- *She **can swim**.* (not ~~*can swimming*~~)

**Only one modal per verb phrase:**
- ~~*She will can swim.*~~ → *She **will be able to** swim.*

### Semi-Modals

Some expressions function like modals but have infinitives:
- *have to*, *need to*, *ought to*, *be going to*, *used to*, *be able to*

*She **has to** leave.* (similar to *must*)
*He **used to** live here.* (past habit)
*They **are going to** win.* (future)

## 16.6 NICE Properties

Auxiliaries share four properties that distinguish them from main verbs, remembered by the acronym **NICE**:

### N - Negation

Auxiliaries take *not* directly:
- *She **can not** (can't) swim.*
- *He **has not** (hasn't) finished.*

Main verbs require *do*:
- ~~*She likes not coffee.*~~ → *She **does not** like coffee.*

### I - Inversion

Auxiliaries invert with the subject in questions:
- *She **can** swim.* → ***Can** she swim?*
- *He **has** finished.* → ***Has** he finished?*

Main verbs require *do*:
- ~~*Likes she coffee?*~~ → ***Does** she like coffee?*

### C - Code (Ellipsis)

Auxiliaries can "stand in" for the full verb phrase:
- *She can swim and I **can** too.* (can = can swim)
- *He has finished. So **has** she.* (has = has finished)

### E - Emphasis

Auxiliaries can be stressed for emphasis:
- *She **CAN** swim!*
- *He **HAS** finished!*

Main verbs require *do*:
- *She **DOES** like coffee!*

---

## 16.7 Multiple Auxiliaries

Complex verb phrases can have multiple auxiliaries in a fixed order:

**Modal → Perfect (have) → Progressive (be) → Passive (be) → Main verb**

### Examples

| Auxiliaries | VP | Analysis |
|-------------|-----|----------|
| 0 | *eats* | simple present |
| 1 | *is eating* | progressive |
| 1 | *has eaten* | perfect |
| 1 | *was eaten* | passive |
| 2 | *has been eating* | perfect + progressive |
| 2 | *will be eaten* | modal + passive |
| 3 | *will have been eating* | modal + perfect + progressive |
| 4 | *will have been being eaten* | modal + perfect + progressive + passive |

### Each Auxiliary Determines Next Form

| Auxiliary | Next Form |
|-----------|-----------|
| Modal | base form |
| Perfect (*have*) | past participle |
| Progressive (*be*) | present participle |
| Passive (*be*) | past participle |

*She **will have been working**.*
- *will* → base (*have*)
- *have* → past participle (*been*)
- *been* → present participle (*working*)

---

## Form and Function Tests

### Identifying Auxiliaries

1. **Apply NICE properties** - does the word invert in questions?
2. **Check position** - is it before the main verb?
3. **Check form** - does it determine the next verb's form?

### Auxiliary or Main Verb?

| Sentence | *Have/Be* as... | Test |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| *She **has** a car.* | Main verb | has + NP |
| *She **has** finished.* | Auxiliary | has + past participle |
| *She **is** happy.* | Main verb | is + AdjP |
| *She **is** running.* | Auxiliary | is + -ing |
