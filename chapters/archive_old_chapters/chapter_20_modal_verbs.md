## 20.1 What Are Modal Verbs?

**Modal verbs** are auxiliary verbs that express **modality**—the speaker's attitude toward the likelihood, necessity, ability, permission, or desirability of an action. They modify the meaning of the main verb without describing an action themselves.

### The Nine Core Modals

English has nine **core modal verbs**:

| Present form | Past form |
|--------------|-----------|
| can | could |
| will | would |
| shall | should |
| may | might |
| must | — |

Note: *Must* lacks a past form. We use alternatives like *had to* for past necessity.

### Grammatical Properties of Modals

Modals have distinctive grammatical behavior:

1. **No -s in third person**: *She **can** swim.* (not *cans*)
2. **Followed by bare infinitive**: *He **must go**.* (not *must to go*)
3. **Form negatives directly**: *cannot, won't, shouldn't*
4. **Form questions by inversion**: *Can she swim?*
5. **No infinitive form**: *~~to can~~, ~~to must~~*
6. **No participle forms**: *~~canning~~, ~~musted~~*
7. **Cannot combine**: *~~will can~~, ~~might should~~*

## 20.2 Categories of Modal Meaning

Modal verbs express three broad categories of meaning:

### Epistemic Modality

**Epistemic modality** expresses the speaker's judgment about the likelihood or certainty of a proposition:

- *She **must** be home by now.* (I conclude this is certain)
- *He **may** have forgotten.* (This is possible)
- *They **can't** be serious.* (I judge this impossible)

Epistemic modals comment on truth or probability.

### Deontic Modality

**Deontic modality** expresses permission, obligation, or prohibition:

- *You **may** leave early.* (I permit this)
- *Students **must** submit their work on time.* (This is required)
- *You **cannot** park here.* (This is prohibited)

Deontic modals govern behavior.

### Dynamic Modality

**Dynamic modality** expresses ability or willingness:

- *She **can** speak four languages.* (ability)
- *I **will** help you.* (willingness)
- *He **won't** cooperate.* (refusal)

Dynamic modals describe the subject's capacity or disposition.

### Same Modal, Different Meanings

Context determines which type of modality a modal expresses:

**Must**:
- Epistemic: *She **must** be tired.* (I conclude this)
- Deontic: *She **must** finish by Friday.* (required)

**Can**:
- Dynamic: *He **can** lift 200 pounds.* (ability)
- Deontic: *You **can** go now.* (permission)
- Epistemic: *That **can't** be right.* (impossibility)

**Will**:
- Dynamic: *I **will** help you.* (willingness)
- Epistemic: *That **will** be the delivery.* (prediction)

## 20.3 Each Modal in Detail

### Can / Could

**Ability (dynamic)**:
- *She **can** play the violin.* (present ability)
- *He **could** swim when he was five.* (past ability)
- *By next year, she **will be able to** drive.* (future ability—use *be able to*)

**Permission (deontic)**:
- ***Can** I borrow your pen?* (informal)
- ***Could** I ask a question?* (more polite)

**Possibility (epistemic)**:
- *It **could** rain later.* (possibility)
- *That **can't** be true.* (impossibility)

**Conditional/hypothetical**:
- *If I had time, I **could** help.* (hypothetical ability)

### Will / Would

**Future/prediction (epistemic)**:
- *She **will** arrive tomorrow.*
- *It **won't** be easy.*

**Willingness/volition (dynamic)**:
- *I**'ll** help you with that.*
- *He **won't** listen to advice.* (refusal)

**Polite requests**:
- ***Will** you pass the salt?*
- ***Would** you mind closing the door?* (more polite)

**Hypothetical (conditional)**:
- *If I won the lottery, I **would** travel the world.*

**Past habit**:
- *On Sundays, we **would** visit my grandmother.*

### Shall / Should

**Shall** (formal, mostly British):
- ***Shall** I open the window?* (offer)
- ***Shall** we begin?* (suggestion)
- *You **shall** not pass!* (emphatic command, literary)

**Should** (advice, expectation):
- *You **should** see a doctor.* (advice)
- *She **should** be here by now.* (expectation)
- *It's surprising that he **should** say that.* (subjunctive-like, formal)

**Ought to** is similar to *should* but slightly stronger.

### May / Might

**Permission (deontic)**:
- ***May** I be excused?* (formal)
- *You **may** leave when you're finished.* (formal permission)

**Possibility (epistemic)**:
- *It **may** rain tomorrow.* (perhaps)
- *She **might** be at the library.* (perhaps, slightly less certain)

**Might have** for past possibility:
- *He **might have** forgotten.* (possibly forgot)

**Concession**:
- *She **may** be talented, but she lacks discipline.*

### Must

**Necessity/obligation (deontic)**:

- *Visitors **must** sign in.* (mandatory)

**Logical conclusion (epistemic)**:
- *She **must** be exhausted after that trip.* (I deduce this)

**No past form**: Use *had to* for past necessity:
- *I **had to** leave early yesterday.*

**Must not vs. don't have to**:
- *You **must not** smoke here.* (prohibited)
- *You **don't have to** attend.* (not necessary, optional)

## 20.4 Semi-Modals and Modal Alternatives

Because core modals lack infinitives and participles, we use **semi-modals** and other expressions to fill gaps:

### Have to / Have got to

Similar to *must* but with more verb-like properties:
- Present: *I **have to** leave now.*
- Past: *I **had to** work late yesterday.*
- Perfect: *I**'ve had to** cancel several times.*
- Infinitive: *I don't want **to have to** explain this again.*

**Have to** often expresses external necessity:
- *I **must** finish this.* (internal motivation)
- *I **have to** finish this.* (external requirement)

### Be able to

Alternative to *can* for ability, especially where modals can't go:
- Future: *You **will be able to** access your account tomorrow.*
- Perfect: *She **has been able to** work from home.*
- After modals: *You **might be able to** get a refund.*

### Be going to

Future alternative to *will*:
- *It**'s going to** rain.* (prediction based on evidence)
- *I**'m going to** study medicine.* (planned intention)

### Ought to

Similar to *should*, slightly more formal:
- *You **ought to** apologize.*
- *This **ought to** work.*

### Need to

Expresses necessity:
- *You **need to** renew your license.*

Note: *Need* can also be a marginal modal: *You **needn't** worry.* (mainly British)

### Used to

Past habit or state:
- *I **used to** live in Seattle.*
- *There **used to** be a park here.*

### Be supposed to

Expectation or obligation:
- *You**'re supposed to** be in class.*
- *It **was supposed to** arrive yesterday.*

### Would rather / Had better

Preference and strong advice:
- *I**'d rather** stay home.* (preference)
- *You**'d better** hurry.* (strong advice, warning)

## 20.5 Negation with Modals

### Forming Negatives

Modal + *not*: *cannot, will not (won't), should not (shouldn't), must not (mustn't), may not, might not*

### Meaning Shifts in Negation

Negation can change which element is negated:

**Must / must not**:
- *You **must** go.* (required to go)
- *You **must not** go.* (required NOT to go—prohibition)

**Have to / don't have to**:
- *You **have to** attend.* (necessary)
- *You **don't have to** attend.* (NOT necessary—optional)

**May / may not**:
- *You **may** leave.* (permitted)
- *You **may not** leave.* (NOT permitted)

**Can / cannot**:
- *That **can** be true.* (possibility exists)
- *That **cannot** be true.* (impossibility)

### Summary of Negation Meanings

| Affirmative | Negative |
|-------------|----------|
| must (obligation) | must not (prohibition) |
| have to (necessity) | don't have to (no necessity) |
| can (permission) | cannot (no permission) |
| can (possibility) | cannot (impossibility) |

## 20.6 Questions with Modals

### Forming Questions

Invert modal and subject:

- *She **can** swim.* → ***Can** she swim?*
- *You **should** wait.* → ***Should** I wait?*
- *He **will** come.* → ***Will** he come?*

### Question Meanings

Questions with modals can express:

**Permission requests**:
- ***May** I speak with you?*
- ***Can** I borrow your notes?*
- ***Could** I ask a favor?* (more polite)

**Requests for action**:
- ***Will** you help me?*
- ***Would** you mind waiting?*
- ***Could** you repeat that?*

**Offers**:
- ***Shall** I carry that for you?*
- ***Can** I get you anything?*

**Information questions**:
- *What **should** I do?*
- *Where **can** I find the office?*
- *When **will** you know?*

---

## 20.7 Modals in Past Time

Core modals have limited ability to express past time. We use alternatives:

### True Past Meanings

**Could** for past ability:
- *I **could** swim when I was young.* (past ability)

**Would** for past habit:
- *We **would** always meet for coffee.* (past routine)

### Modal + Have + Past Participle

For past speculation or unrealized possibility:

- ***Must have**: *She **must have** left early.* (I conclude she did)
- ***May/might have**: *He **might have** forgotten.* (perhaps he did)
- ***Could have**: *You **could have** been hurt!* (past possibility)
- ***Should have**: *I **should have** called.* (past obligation unfulfilled—regret)
- ***Would have**: *I **would have** helped if I'd known.* (conditional past)

### Examples of Modal Perfect

**Epistemic (past)**:
- *The package **must have** arrived by now.*
- *She **can't have** known about this.*
- *They **might have** misunderstood.*

**Deontic (unfulfilled)**:
- *You **should have** told me sooner.* (but you didn't)
- *He **ought to have** apologized.* (but he didn't)

**Conditional past**:
- *If I had known, I **would have** come.*
- *She **could have** won if she'd tried harder.*

## 20.8 Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Could is always past tense of can"

**Partial truth**: *Could* sometimes indicates past ability, but often it's:
- Conditional: *If I had time, I **could** help.*
- Polite: ***Could** you pass the salt?* (present request)
- Possibility: *It **could** rain.* (present/future possibility)

### Misconception 2: "May and might are interchangeable"

**Nuanced**: Both express possibility, but:
- *May* is slightly more likely
- *Might* can express counterfactual: *If he had asked, I **might** have helped.* (*may* is odd here)
- *May* expresses permission; *might* rarely does in modern English

### Misconception 3: "Must means have to"

**Different**:
- *Must* often implies internal motivation or logical conclusion
- *Have to* implies external requirement
- In negation, they differ completely: *must not* = prohibition; *don't have to* = no necessity

### Misconception 4: "Shall is just formal will"

**Different uses**:
- *Shall* in questions offers or suggests: *Shall we dance?*
- *Will* in questions requests: *Will you help?*
- First-person *shall* (British) indicates simple future

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Modal Analysis

Find a set of instructions (recipe, assembly guide, safety rules). Identify all modals and classify them by type. Why are certain modals chosen?

### Activity 2: Polite Requests

Write three versions of the same request with increasing levels of politeness using different modals:
- Direct: *Pass the salt.*
- Polite: ?
- Very polite: ?

### Activity 3: Past Speculation

Write a short paragraph speculating about a historical event (what might have happened, what must have been the case, what could have occurred differently).

---

## Chapter Summary

- **Modal verbs** (can, could, will, would, shall, should, may, might, must) express modality—attitude toward necessity, possibility, ability, and permission.
- **Epistemic modality** concerns likelihood and certainty; **deontic modality** concerns permission and obligation; **dynamic modality** concerns ability and willingness.
- The same modal can express different meanings depending on context.
- **Semi-modals** (*have to, be able to, be going to, ought to*) fill gaps where core modals can't be used.
- **Modal + have + past participle** expresses past speculation or unfulfilled obligation.
- Negation affects meaning differently across modals: *must not* (prohibition) vs. *don't have to* (no necessity).
