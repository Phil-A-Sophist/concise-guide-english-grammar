## 5.1 Open and Closed Classes

All words in English belong to categories called **parts of speech** (or **word classes**). These categories aren't arbitrary; they reflect how words behave grammatically—what positions they can occupy, what other words they can combine with, and what inflections they can take.

Parts of speech fall into two major groups: **open classes** and **closed classes**.

### Open-Class Words

**Open classes** regularly accept new members. When English needs new words, they almost always join these categories:

- **Nouns**: *selfie*, *cryptocurrency*, *podcast*
- **Verbs**: *google*, *text*, *tweet*
- **Adjectives**: *viral*, *sustainable*, *toxic* (new meaning)
- **Adverbs**: *ironically*, *literally* (new usage)

Open-class words carry most of the content meaning in a sentence. They are sometimes called **content words** or **lexical words**.

### Closed-Class Words

**Closed classes** have a relatively fixed membership that rarely changes. New pronouns, prepositions, or conjunctions almost never enter the language.

- **Pronouns**: *I*, *you*, *he*, *she*, *it*, *we*, *they*
- **Determiners**: *the*, *a*, *this*, *some*, *every*
- **Prepositions**: *in*, *on*, *at*, *to*, *from*, *with*
- **Conjunctions**: *and*, *but*, *or*, *because*, *although*
- **Auxiliary verbs**: *be*, *have*, *do*, *can*, *will*, *must*

Closed-class words provide grammatical structure. They are sometimes called **function words** or **grammatical words**.

### Why the Distinction Matters

The open/closed distinction has practical consequences:

1. **Vocabulary learning**: When you encounter an unfamiliar word, it's almost certainly open-class. Closed-class words are learned early and rarely forgotten.

2. **Language change**: New words enter open classes all the time, but closed classes are stable for centuries.

3. **Part of speech identification**: If you can't determine a word's category, check if it's on the short list of closed-class words. If not, it's probably open-class.

## 5.2 Open-Class Words: The Content Words

### Nouns

**Nouns** typically name people, places, things, or ideas. But rather than relying on meaning (which can be misleading), we identify nouns by their grammatical behavior.

**Morphological tests (form):**
- Can usually become plural: *book* → *books*, *happiness* → *happinesses*
- Can take possessive marking: *John's*, *the dog's*

**Syntactic tests (function):**
- Can follow a determiner: *the book*, *a happiness*, *their proposal*
- Can be modified by adjectives: *the heavy book*, *great happiness*
- Can be replaced by a pronoun: *The book fell* → *It fell*

**Surprising nouns** (don't look like typical nouns):
- *-tion* nouns: *action*, *decision*, *exception*
- *-ness* nouns: *happiness*, *awkwardness*, *cleverness*
- *-ity* nouns: *curiosity*, *generosity*, *serendipity*

**Examples in sentences:**
- *The young **artist** painted beautiful **landscapes**.*
- ***Wisdom** comes through difficult **experiences**.*

### Verbs

**Verbs** typically express actions, states, or occurrences. Again, we rely on grammatical tests rather than meaning.

**Morphological tests (form):**
- Can be inflected for tense: *walk* → *walked*, *go* → *went*
- Can take progressive *-ing*: *walking*, *going*
- Has third-person singular *-s*: *she walks*, *he goes*

**Syntactic tests (function):**
- Can follow a modal auxiliary: *can walk*, *might go*, *will see*
- Can follow *to* (infinitive marker): *to walk*, *to go*, *to see*
- Can take an object: *kick the ball*, *read the book*

**Surprising verbs:**
- Forms of *be*: *is*, *are*, *was*, *were*, *been*, *being*
- Forms of *have*: *has*, *had*, *having*
- Forms of *do*: *does*, *did*, *doing*
- Forms of *go*: *goes*, *went*, *gone*, *going*

**Examples in sentences:**
- *The artist **painted** beautiful landscapes.*
- *She **is** truly talented.*

### Adjectives

**Adjectives** typically describe or modify nouns. They tell us what kind, which one, or how many.

**Morphological tests (form):**
- Can be made comparative/superlative: *tall* → *taller* → *tallest*
- Can often add *-ish*: *tallish*, *reddish*, *youngish*
- Many can become adverbs with *-ly*: *happy* → *happily*

**Syntactic tests (function):**
- Can appear between a determiner and a noun: *the **tall** man*
- Can be modified by *very*: *very tall*, *very happy*
- Can follow linking verbs (*be*, *seem*, *appear*): *She is **tall***

**Examples in sentences:**
- *The **young** artist painted **beautiful** landscapes.*
- *Three **ambitious** students study in the library.*

### Adverbs

**Adverbs** modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire sentences. They're the most versatile modifiers in English.

**Morphological tests (form):**
- Many end in *-ly* and can be converted to adjectives by removing it: *quickly* → *quick*
- Some have comparative forms: *fast* → *faster*, *soon* → *sooner*

**Syntactic tests (function):**
- Can modify verbs (appear near the verb): *She spoke **quietly***
- Can modify adjectives: *a **truly** remarkable achievement*
- Can modify other adverbs: *She spoke **very** quietly*
- Can modify whole sentences: ***Unfortunately**, I can't attend*
- Cannot appear between a determiner and noun: ~~*the quickly man*~~

**Types of adverbs:**
- Manner: *quickly*, *carefully*, *gracefully*
- Time: *always*, *never*, *sometimes*, *often*, *usually*
- Degree: *very*, *somewhat*, *quite*, *rather*
- Sentence: *however*, *therefore*, *unfortunately*

**Examples in sentences:**
- *The small child **quietly** read her book.*
- ***Usually**, he runs in the morning.*

## 5.3 Closed-Class Words: The Function Words

### Pronouns

**Pronouns** replace entire noun phrases (not just nouns). They form a closed class with fixed members.

**Types of pronouns:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Personal | *I*, *you*, *he*, *she*, *it*, *we*, *they* |
| Possessive | *mine*, *yours*, *his*, *hers*, *ours*, *theirs* |
| Reflexive | *myself*, *yourself*, *himself*, *herself*, *itself* |
| Demonstrative | *this*, *that*, *these*, *those* |
| Interrogative | *who*, *what*, *which*, *where*, *when* |
| Relative | *who*, *whom*, *which*, *that*, *whose* |
| Indefinite | *someone*, *anybody*, *nothing*, *everything* |

**Important**: Pronouns replace the entire noun phrase:
- *The tall man from Boston* → *He* (not ~~*The tall he from Boston*~~)

### Determiners

**Determiners** introduce noun phrases and help specify reference. They're not adjectives—they behave differently.

**Types of determiners:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Articles | *a*, *an*, *the* |
| Demonstratives | *this*, *that*, *these*, *those* |
| Possessives | *my*, *your*, *his*, *her*, *its*, *our*, *their*, *Bob's* |
| Quantifiers | *some*, *any*, *many*, *few*, *all*, *every*, *no* |
| Numbers | *one*, *two*, *three*, *first*, *second* |

**Distinguishing determiners from adjectives:**

1. Determiners usually precede adjectives:
   - *the big red ball* (determiner → adjectives → noun)

2. Most nouns take only one or two determiners but multiple adjectives:
   - *the many big red bouncy balls* ✓
   - ~~*the a many ball*~~ ✗

3. Adjectives are gradable; most determiners aren't:
   - *very tall* ✓ (adjective)
   - ~~*very the*~~ ✗ (determiner)

### Prepositions

**Prepositions** show relationships between elements—typically spatial, temporal, or logical relationships. A traditional mnemonic: "anywhere a cat can be."

**Common prepositions:**
*in*, *on*, *at*, *to*, *from*, *with*, *by*, *for*, *about*, *between*, *through*, *during*, *before*, *after*, *above*, *below*, *near*, *under*, *over*

**Prepositions combine with noun phrases to form prepositional phrases:**
- *in* + *the house* = *in the house*
- *to* + *my friend* = *to my friend*

**Prepositional phrases function as modifiers:**
- Noun modifier (adjectival): *The man **in the hat***
- Verb modifier (adverbial): *She swam **in the sea***
- Sentence modifier: ***In the morning**, we will leave*

### Conjunctions

**Conjunctions** connect words, phrases, or clauses.

**Coordinating conjunctions** (connect equal elements):
- *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *yet*, *so* (FANBOYS)
- *I like coffee **and** tea.*
- *She is smart **but** lazy.*

**Subordinating conjunctions** (introduce dependent clauses):
- *because*, *although*, *if*, *when*, *while*, *after*, *before*, *since*, *unless*
- *I stayed home **because** I was sick.*
- ***Although** she was tired, she kept working.*

**Correlative conjunctions** (work in pairs):
- *both...and*, *either...or*, *neither...nor*, *not only...but also*
- ***Both** the cat **and** the dog escaped.*

## 5.4 Form vs. Function: The Critical Distinction

One of the most important concepts in grammar is the distinction between **form** and **function**.

**Form** refers to a word's part of speech—its inherent grammatical category based on morphology and typical behavior.

**Function** refers to the role a word plays in a particular sentence.

### When Form and Function Match

Usually, form and function align:

*I run **very quickly**.*
- Form: *quickly* is an adverb (ends in *-ly*, modifies verb)
- Function: *quickly* functions as an adverb (modifies the verb *run*)

### When Form and Function Clash

Sometimes a word's function differs from its typical form:

*I run **very fast**.*
- Form: *fast* is an adjective (has superlative *fastest*, can modify nouns: *a fast car*)
- Function: *fast* functions as an adverb (modifies the verb *run*)

*There is a **fly** in my room.*
- Form: *fly* is typically a verb (*I fly*, *she flies*)
- Function: *fly* functions as a noun (follows determiner *a*, names a thing)

*I need to **test** the equipment.*
- Form: *test* can be noun or verb
- Function: *test* functions as a verb (follows *to*, takes object)

*We scheduled a **test** for Friday.*
- Form: *test* can be noun or verb
- Function: *test* functions as a noun (follows determiner *a*)

### Why This Matters

The form/function distinction is crucial for several reasons, and understanding it will serve you throughout this book and beyond.

**Words are flexible**: English allows words to function in multiple ways—more so than many other languages. This flexibility is a feature, not a bug. It lets us use familiar words in new contexts (*I need to Google that*), create compounds freely (*a dog walk*, *a walk-in closet*), and express ideas concisely.

**Labels depend on use**: Saying "this word is a noun" without context is often incomplete. The "correct" label depends on how a word is used in a specific sentence. The word *light* is an adjective in "a light lunch," a noun in "the light flickered," and a verb in "light the candle." Same word, three different functions—and three different grammatical behaviors.

**Analysis requires both**: Complete grammatical analysis considers both what a word *is* (form) and what it's *doing* (function). When we get to sentence diagramming in Chapter 6 and beyond, you'll see that structural position often matters more than the dictionary definition of a word.

### Extended Examples

Let's work through some examples more carefully to see how form and function interact.

**Example 1**: *The poor need our help.*

At first glance, *poor* looks like an adjective—and by form, it is. It can be graded (*poorer*), it can modify nouns (*a poor family*), it can follow linking verbs (*They are poor*). But in this sentence, *poor* functions as a noun. It follows the determiner "the," it serves as the subject of the sentence, and it refers to a group of people. We might say: "Form: adjective; Function: noun (subject)."

This pattern—adjectives functioning as nouns to refer to groups—is common: *the rich*, *the elderly*, *the homeless*, *the unemployed*. The adjective form is repurposed for a nominal function.

**Example 2**: *I love to read.*

The word *read* is a verb by form—it can be past tense (*read* [pronounced "red"]), it can take *-ing* (*reading*), it can take objects (*read the book*). In this sentence, though, it functions as part of an infinitive phrase (*to read*) that serves as the direct object of *love*. The entire phrase answers "What do you love?" So while *read* keeps its verb form, the phrase it heads functions nominally.

**Example 3**: *That was a career-ending mistake.*

The word *career* is a noun by form—you can pluralize it (*careers*), put a determiner before it (*the career*), modify it with adjectives (*a long career*). But in "career-ending," it functions as a modifier, part of a compound adjective describing what kind of mistake. The noun has shifted into an adjectival role.

### Why This Matters for the Rest of the Book

Throughout Part II, you'll encounter phrases that work differently than you might expect based on the words inside them. Noun phrases can contain adjectives, prepositional phrases, and even clauses—but the whole unit functions as a nominal element. Prepositional phrases (headed by prepositions) function sometimes adjectivally, sometimes adverbially. Understanding that the function of a phrase isn't determined solely by the form of its individual words is essential for accurate analysis.

When you diagram sentences, you'll label both the category (NP, VP, PP, etc.) and the function (subject, object, modifier, etc.). The form/function distinction makes this dual labeling possible—and necessary.

When analyzing sentences, always ask: "What is this word's form?" AND "What function is it serving here?"

## Form and Function Tests

### Quick Reference: Identifying Parts of Speech

| Part of Speech | Key Tests |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Noun** | Can become plural; follows determiner; replaceable by pronoun |
| **Verb** | Can become past tense; follows modal (*can*, *will*); takes *-ing* |
| **Adjective** | Can become comparative; appears between determiner and noun; modified by *very* |
| **Adverb** | Often ends in *-ly*; modifies verbs/adjectives/sentences; cannot appear between determiner and noun |
| **Determiner** | Introduces NP; precedes adjectives; not gradable |
| **Preposition** | Followed by NP; shows relationship |
| **Pronoun** | Replaces entire NP; fixed set of forms |

### Analysis Process

1. **Consider the word in isolation**: What part of speech does it typically belong to? (form)

2. **Consider the word in context**: What is it doing in this sentence? (function)

3. **Apply tests**: Use morphological and syntactic tests to confirm.

4. **Note any mismatch**: If form and function differ, identify both.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Open or Closed Class?

Identify whether each word belongs to an open class (O) or a closed class (C).

1. *beautiful*
2. *the*
3. *running*
4. *she*
5. *between*
6. *happiness*
7. *and*
8. *quickly*
9. *those*
10. *podcast*

### Exercise 2: Part of Speech Identification

Identify the part of speech of each underlined word.

1. *The small **child** quietly read her favorite book.*
2. *The small child **quietly** read her favorite book.*
3. *My **older** brother works at the local hospital.*
4. *My older brother works **at** the local hospital.*
5. ***She** gave the book to him.*
6. *I need **some** help with this project.*
7. *The students study **because** they want to succeed.*
8. *The **interesting** lecture lasted two hours.*

### Exercise 3: Form vs. Function

For each underlined word, identify both its form (typical part of speech) and its function (role in this sentence).

1. *I love **reading**.*
2. *We took a **walk** in the park.*
3. *The **poor** deserve our help.*
4. *She runs **fast**.*
5. *That is a very **today** attitude.* (informal)

### Exercise 4: Determiner or Adjective?

Identify whether each underlined word is a determiner (Det) or an adjective (Adj). Explain your reasoning.

1. ***The** tall man entered.*
2. *The **tall** man entered.*
3. ***Many** students passed.*
4. ***Several** important documents are missing.*
5. ***His** new car is fast.*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Part of Speech Flexibility

English allows many words to function as different parts of speech. Find three words that can function as at least two different parts of speech. For each word:
- Write sentences showing each function
- Explain how you know what part of speech it is in each sentence

Example: *run*
- Verb: *I **run** every morning.* (can be past tense: *ran*)
- Noun: *The **run** was exhausting.* (follows determiner *the*)

### Activity 2: Closed-Class Challenge

Closed classes rarely accept new members, but occasionally they do. Research one of the following and report on whether it has succeeded in entering the language:
- *they/them* as singular pronouns
- new prepositions (are there any?)
- attempts to create gender-neutral pronouns

### Activity 3: Text Analysis

Choose a paragraph from a newspaper article or textbook. Create a table listing every word and its part of speech. Then answer:
- What percentage are open-class words?
- What percentage are closed-class words?
- What does this tell you about how sentences are built?

## Looking Ahead: From Words to Sentences

Words don't float independently in sentences—they combine into **phrases** with internal structure. The parts of speech you've learned in this chapter are the building blocks, but understanding grammar requires seeing how those blocks fit together.

Consider a simple noun phrase like "the tall man." The noun *man* is the **head**—the essential element that determines the phrase's category. The determiner *the* and the adjective *tall* cluster around this head, adding information about which man we mean. This grouping isn't arbitrary; it reflects how our minds organize language into meaningful units.

Chapter 6 introduces the **diagramming system** we'll use throughout this book to visualize these structures. You'll learn to read and draw **tree diagrams** that reveal the hidden architecture of sentences—showing which words group together, what modifies what, and how meaning emerges from structure.

## Chapter Summary

- **Open-class** words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) carry content meaning and regularly accept new members.
- **Closed-class** words (pronouns, determiners, prepositions, conjunctions) provide grammatical structure and rarely change.
- We identify parts of speech through **morphological tests** (form—how the word can be modified) and **syntactic tests** (function—how the word behaves in sentences).
- The **form vs. function** distinction is critical: a word's part of speech (form) may differ from its role in a particular sentence (function).
- Determiners and adjectives both modify nouns but behave differently: determiners precede adjectives, cannot be graded, and form a closed class.
- Each part of speech has characteristic tests that help identify it reliably.
