## 21.1 Finite vs. Non-Finite Verbs

### Finite Verbs

**Finite verbs** are marked for tense and agree with their subjects. Every complete sentence requires at least one finite verb:

- *She **walks** to work.* (present tense, third person)
- *They **walked** home.* (past tense)
- *The report **was** submitted.* (past tense, passive)

Finite verbs can stand as the main verb of an independent clause.

### Non-Finite Verbs

**Non-finite verbs** lack tense marking and don't agree with subjects. They cannot serve as the main verb of a sentence alone:

| Form | Example | Can stand alone? |
|------|---------|------------------|
| To-infinitive | *to walk* | No |
| Bare infinitive | *walk* | No |
| Gerund | *walking* (as noun) | No |
| Present participle | *walking* | No |
| Past participle | *walked* | No |

Non-finite forms function as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, or combine with finite auxiliaries.

### Combined Forms

Non-finite verbs often combine with finite auxiliaries:
- *She **is walking**.* (*is* = finite; *walking* = non-finite)
- *They **have finished**.* (*have* = finite; *finished* = non-finite)
- *I **want to leave**.* (*want* = finite; *to leave* = non-finite)

---

## 21.2 Infinitives

English has two infinitive forms: the **to-infinitive** and the **bare infinitive**.

### To-Infinitive

The to-infinitive consists of *to* + base verb: *to go, to write, to be*

**Noun functions**:

*Subject*:
- ***To err** is human.*
- ***To forgive** is divine.*

*Direct object*:
- *I want **to leave**.*
- *She hopes **to graduate** in May.*

*Subject complement*:
- *My goal is **to improve**.*
- *The best option is **to wait**.*

**Adverbial functions** (expressing purpose):
- *She stopped **to rest**.* (in order to rest)
- *I came **to help**.* (for the purpose of helping)

**Adjectival functions** (modifying nouns):
- *This is a good book **to read**.*
- *I have work **to do**.*
- *She's the person **to ask**.*

### Bare Infinitive

The bare infinitive is the base form without *to*: *go, write, be*

Used after:

**Modals**:
- *She **can swim**.*
- *You **must leave**.*

**Perception verbs** (*see, hear, watch, feel, notice*):
- *I saw her **leave**.*
- *We heard them **argue**.*

**Causative verbs** (*let, make, have*):
- *Let me **help**.*
- *She made him **apologize**.*
- *I'll have the mechanic **check** it.*

**Help** (either form):
- *She helped me **carry** the boxes.* (bare infinitive)
- *She helped me **to carry** the boxes.* (to-infinitive—also correct)

### Perfect and Progressive Infinitives

**Perfect infinitive** (*to have* + past participle):
- *She seems **to have forgotten**.*
- *He claims **to have met** the president.*

**Progressive infinitive** (*to be* + -ing):
- *She appears **to be sleeping**.*
- *He pretended **to be working**.*

**Perfect progressive infinitive**:
- *They seem **to have been waiting** for hours.*

### Check Your Understanding

What function does the infinitive serve?

*To understand grammar is to understand language.*
*(Answer: Both infinitives function as subjects—"To understand grammar" is the subject of "is")*

---

## 21.3 Gerunds

**Gerunds** are -ing verb forms functioning as nouns. They look identical to present participles but serve different grammatical roles.

### Identifying Gerunds

If the -ing form functions as a noun (subject, object, complement), it's a gerund:
- ***Swimming** is excellent exercise.* (subject—gerund)
- *I enjoy **reading**.* (direct object—gerund)
- *Her hobby is **gardening**.* (subject complement—gerund)

### Functions of Gerunds

**Subject**:
- ***Running** strengthens the heart.*
- ***Learning** a language takes time.*

**Direct object**:
- *I enjoy **hiking**.*
- *She finished **writing** the report.*

**Object of preposition**:
- *I'm interested in **learning** more.*
- *She's good at **solving** problems.*
- *Thank you for **helping**.*

**Subject complement**:
- *My favorite activity is **reading**.*
- *Seeing is **believing**.*

### Gerunds with Objects and Modifiers

Gerunds can take their own objects and modifiers:
- *I enjoy **reading novels**.* (gerund + object)
- *She appreciates **your helping her**.* (gerund phrase)
- ***Carefully reviewing the evidence** led to new conclusions.* (modified gerund phrase)

### Possessive with Gerunds

Formal usage prefers a possessive before a gerund:
- *I appreciate **your helping** me.* (formal)
- *I appreciate **you helping** me.* (informal)
- ***His leaving** early surprised everyone.* (formal)
- ***Him leaving** early surprised everyone.* (informal)

### Verbs Followed by Gerunds

These verbs typically take gerund complements:

*admit, avoid, consider, delay, deny, dislike, enjoy, escape, finish, imagine, keep, mind, miss, postpone, practice, quit, recall, recommend, regret, resist, risk, suggest*

- *She **admitted making** a mistake.*
- *I **can't imagine living** there.*
- *He **suggested postponing** the meeting.*

## 21.4 Gerund vs. Infinitive: Meaning Differences

Some verbs accept both gerund and infinitive with different meanings:

### Stop

- ***Stop smoking*** = quit the habit
- ***Stop to smoke*** = pause in order to smoke

### Remember / Forget

- ***Remember doing*** = recall a past action
  - *I remember **meeting** you last year.* (I recall that meeting)
- ***Remember to do*** = not forget a future action
  - *Remember **to lock** the door.* (don't forget)

- ***Forget doing*** = not recall a past action
  - *I'll never forget **visiting** Paris.* (the memory stays with me)
- ***Forget to do*** = fail to remember a required action
  - *I forgot **to call** her.* (I should have but didn't)

### Try

- ***Try doing*** = experiment with an action
  - *Try **turning** it off and on.* (see if this works)
- ***Try to do*** = make an effort/attempt
  - *I tried **to open** the jar.* (I attempted but maybe failed)

### Regret

- ***Regret doing*** = feel sorry about a past action
  - *I regret **saying** that.* (I wish I hadn't)
- ***Regret to do*** = be sorry to (formal announcement)
  - *I regret **to inform** you...* (formal—I'm sorry to tell you)

### Go on

- ***Go on doing*** = continue the same action
  - *She went on **talking** for an hour.* (kept talking)
- ***Go on to do*** = proceed to the next action
  - *She went on **to become** a doctor.* (next stage)

### Check Your Understanding

Choose the correct form:

*I'll never forget (to meet / meeting) the president.*
*(Answer: "meeting"—recalling a memorable past experience)*

*Remember (to send / sending) the email before you leave.*
*(Answer: "to send"—don't forget this future task)*

## 21.5 Participles

Participles are verb forms that function as adjectives or combine with auxiliaries.

### Present Participle (-ing)

**In progressive aspect** (with *be*):
- *She **is working**.*
- *They **were sleeping**.*

**As adjective** (modifying nouns):
- *the **running** water*
- *an **interesting** book*
- *the **growing** concern*

**In participial phrases**:
- ***Feeling tired**, she went to bed early.*
- *The dog, **barking loudly**, scared the visitors.*

### Past Participle (-ed/-en/irregular)

**In perfect aspect** (with *have*):
- *She **has finished**.*
- *They **had written** the letter.*

**In passive voice** (with *be*):
- *The report **was completed**.*
- *The window **has been broken**.*

**As adjective**:
- *a **broken** window*
- *the **written** instructions*
- *a **frozen** lake*

**In participial phrases**:
- ***Exhausted by the journey**, they collapsed into bed.*
- *The artifact, **discovered in 1922**, is now in a museum.*

### Present vs. Past Participles as Adjectives

**Present participle** → cause or active quality:
- *The movie was **boring**.* (it caused boredom)
- *The **confusing** instructions frustrated everyone.* (they confused people)

**Past participle** → effect or passive quality:
- *I was **bored**.* (I experienced boredom)
- *The **confused** students asked for help.* (they were confused)

Common pairs:
| Present (-ing) | Past (-ed) |
|----------------|------------|
| amazing | amazed |
| boring | bored |
| confusing | confused |
| exciting | excited |
| frightening | frightened |
| interesting | interested |
| surprising | surprised |
| tiring | tired |

## 21.6 Participial Phrases

**Participial phrases** consist of a participle plus related words (objects, modifiers). They function as adjectives, modifying nouns or pronouns.

### Position of Participial Phrases

**Beginning of sentence**:
- ***Walking through the park**, she noticed a strange bird.*
- ***Convinced of his innocence**, the jury acquitted him.*

**End of sentence**:
- *She left the room, **slamming the door behind her**.*
- *The package arrived, **damaged beyond repair**.*

**After the noun**:
- *The woman **sitting by the window** is my aunt.*
- *The documents **signed by the CEO** are in the folder.*

### Dangling Participles

A **dangling participle** is a participial phrase that doesn't clearly modify the intended noun. This creates confusing or absurd sentences:

**Incorrect**:
- ***Running to catch the bus**, my coffee spilled.* (coffee wasn't running)
- ***Exhausted from the hike**, the hotel looked inviting.* (hotel wasn't exhausted)
- ***Walking down the street**, the trees were beautiful.* (trees weren't walking)

**Corrected**:
- ***Running to catch the bus**, I spilled my coffee.*
- ***Exhausted from the hike**, we found the hotel inviting.*
- ***Walking down the street**, I noticed the beautiful trees.*

### The Rule

The participial phrase must modify the subject of the main clause. Check by asking: "Who or what is [participle]-ing?" The answer should be the subject.

### Misplaced Participial Phrases

Even properly attached participles can be confusing if misplaced:

**Confusing**: *She served cake to the guests covered in chocolate.*
(Were the guests covered in chocolate?)

**Clear**: *She served cake covered in chocolate to the guests.*

## 21.7 Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Gerunds and present participles are different words"

**Reality**: The form is identical (-ing). The distinction is functional:
- **Gerund**: *Swimming is fun.* (functions as noun)
- **Participle**: *The swimming pool is closed.* (functions as adjective)

### Misconception 2: "Split infinitives are always wrong"

**Reality**: Placing an adverb between *to* and the verb (*to boldly go*) is grammatically acceptable and sometimes clearer:
- Natural: *She decided **to gradually increase** her training.*
- Awkward: *She decided **gradually to increase** her training.*

### Misconception 3: "After prepositions, always use -ing"

**Truth**: After prepositions, use gerunds (not infinitives):
- ✓ *interested in **learning***
- ✗ *interested in **to learn***

But *to* in infinitives isn't a preposition—it's the infinitive marker:
- *I want **to learn**.* (infinitive, not preposition)

### Misconception 4: "Danglers only happen with participles"

**Reality**: Any modifying phrase can dangle:
- *As a child, my parents moved frequently.* (Were your parents a child?)
- Better: *When I was a child, my parents moved frequently.*

## Chapter Summary

- **Finite verbs** show tense and agree with subjects; **non-finite verbs** (infinitives, gerunds, participles) don't.

- **Gerunds** (-ing forms as nouns) follow certain verbs and all prepositions.
- Some verbs take **either gerund or infinitive** with meaning differences (*stop, remember, try, forget*).
- **Present participles** (-ing) and **past participles** (-ed/-en) function in verb phrases and as adjectives.
- **Participial phrases** must clearly modify the subject; otherwise, they **dangle**.
