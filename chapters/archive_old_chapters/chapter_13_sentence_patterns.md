## 13.1 Why Sentence Patterns Matter

Every complete sentence in English follows one of six basic structural patterns. These patterns aren't arbitrary—they emerge from how different types of verbs work. Some verbs need nothing after them to form a complete thought. Others require an object to receive the action. Still others need a word or phrase that describes or renames the subject.

Understanding these patterns gives you a framework for analyzing any sentence you encounter. When you can identify a sentence's pattern, you understand its core architecture—which elements are essential and which are optional additions.

Think of sentence patterns like recipes. A basic bread recipe requires flour, water, yeast, and salt—those are the essential ingredients. You might add herbs, honey, or seeds, but without the core ingredients, you don't have bread. Similarly, each sentence pattern has required elements that make it complete. Adverbs and prepositional phrases can be added to any pattern, but they're extras, not essentials.

## 13.2 Overview: The Six Patterns

| Pattern | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1. Intransitive | Subject + Verb | *Thunder rumbled.* |
| 2. Copular *be* | Subject + *be* + Subject Complement | *She is a violinist.* |
| 3. Linking verb | Subject + Linking Verb + Subject Complement | *The bread smells wonderful.* |
| 4. Transitive | Subject + Verb + Direct Object | *Squirrels gather acorns.* |
| 5. Ditransitive (IO + DO) | Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object | *The librarian handed me a book.* |
| 6. Ditransitive (DO + OC) | Subject + Verb + Direct Object + Object Complement | *The jury found her guilty.* |

**Important**: Adverbials (words and phrases indicating time, place, manner, or reason) can appear in any pattern without changing its classification. When identifying patterns, mentally set aside these optional modifiers first.

---

## 13.3 Pattern 1: Intransitive Sentences

### Structure: Subject + Verb

**Intransitive verbs** express complete actions or states without needing a receiver. The subject does something, and that's the whole story.

### Examples

| Subject | Verb |
|---------|------|
| Thunder | rumbled |
| My grandmother | sneezed |
| The toast | burned |
| Nothing | happened |
| Her voice | trembled |

### What Makes It Intransitive?

The verb alone completes the thought. You can add modifiers, but you don't need an object:

- *Thunder rumbled **across the valley**.* (still intransitive—"across the valley" is an adverbial)
- *My grandmother sneezed **violently**.* (still intransitive—"violently" is an adverb)

### Exclusively Intransitive Verbs

Some verbs can only be intransitive:
- *arrive*, *collapse*, *disappear*, *emerge*, *exist*, *fall*, *hesitate*, *occur*, *sneeze*, *vanish*

You cannot say *"She arrived the station"* or *"The building collapsed the roof."* These verbs don't take objects.

### Diagram: Intransitive Pattern

*Figure 12.1: An intransitive sentence. The subject noun phrase and verb phrase branch from S. Note that "home" here functions as an adverbial, not an object.*

### Check Your Understanding

Which sentence is intransitive?
- A. *The child dropped the glass.*
- B. *The glass shattered.*
- C. *The glass was expensive.*

*(Answer: B—"shattered" takes no object or complement)*

---

## 13.4 Pattern 2: Copular *Be* Sentences

### Structure: Subject + *Be* + Subject Complement

The verb **be** (in all its forms: *am*, *is*, *are*, *was*, *were*, *been*, *being*) links the subject to a **subject complement**—a word or phrase that describes or identifies the subject.

### Examples

| Subject | Be | Subject Complement | Complement Type |
|---------|----|--------------------|-----------------|
| She | is | a violinist | NP |
| The solution | was | surprisingly simple | AdjP |
| My keys | are | under the cushion | PP |
| Tomorrow | will be | Tuesday | NP |
| The children | were | exhausted | AdjP |

### Three Types of Subject Complements

**Noun Phrase (NP)**: Identifies who or what the subject is
- *Marcus **is a carpenter**.*
- *The winner **was my neighbor**.*

**Adjective Phrase (AdjP)**: Describes a quality of the subject
- *The water **is cold**.*
- *Her argument **was remarkably persuasive**.*

**Prepositional Phrase (PP)**: Locates or describes the subject
- *The restaurant **is around the corner**.*
- *My patience **is at its limit**.*

### Diagram: Copular *Be* with NP Complement

*Figure 12.4: Copular be with a prepositional phrase complement. The PP locates the subject.*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the subject complement and its type:
*The meeting was a disaster.*
*(Answer: "a disaster" — NP)*

---

## 13.5 Pattern 3: Linking Verb Sentences

### Structure: Subject + Linking Verb + Subject Complement

**Linking verbs** work like *be*—they connect the subject to a complement that describes or identifies it. The key test: can you substitute a form of *be* and keep essentially the same meaning?

### Examples

| Subject | Linking Verb | Subject Complement | Type |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|----- |
| The bread | smells | wonderful | AdjP |
| Her excuse | sounded | plausible | AdjP |
| The forecast | looks | grim | AdjP |
| That musician | became | famous | AdjP |
| The caterpillar | became | a butterfly | NP |

### The Substitution Test

If you can replace the verb with a form of *be* and the sentence still makes sense (even if the meaning shifts slightly), the verb is linking:

- *The bread smells wonderful.* → *The bread **is** wonderful.* ✓ (Linking)
- *The bread smells fresh.* → *The bread **is** fresh.* ✓ (Linking)
- *The detective smells trouble.* → *The detective **is** trouble.* ✗ (Not linking—transitive!)

### Common Linking Verbs

*appear, become, feel, get, grow, look, prove, remain, seem, smell, sound, stay, taste, turn*

**Warning**: Many of these verbs can also be transitive:
- *She **felt** nervous.* (linking—"nervous" describes "she")
- *She **felt** the fabric.* (transitive—"fabric" is a direct object)

### Diagram: Linking Verb with AdjP

![Tree diagram showing linking verb with AdjP](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-12-linking-adj.png)

*Figure 12.5: A linking verb sentence. "Seem" connects the subject to the adjective complement.*

### Diagram: Linking Verb with NP

*Figure 12.6: A linking verb with a noun phrase complement. "Became" links subject to predicate nominative.*

### Check Your Understanding

Is "grow" linking or transitive here?
- *The tomatoes grew ripe.* (Answer: Linking—"ripe" describes tomatoes)
- *The farmer grew tomatoes.* (Answer: Transitive—"tomatoes" is direct object)

---

## 13.6 Pattern 4: Transitive Sentences

### Structure: Subject + Verb + Direct Object

**Transitive verbs** require a **direct object**—a noun phrase that receives the action or is affected by it.

### Examples

| Subject | Verb | Direct Object |
|---------|------|---------------|
| Squirrels | gather | acorns |
| The tornado | destroyed | the barn |
| Nobody | expected | this outcome |
| She | finished | her dissertation |
| Lightning | struck | the old oak |

### Direct Object Tests

1. **Who/What question**: Ask "verb what?" or "verb whom?"
   - *Squirrels gather **what**?* → *acorns*

2. **Pronoun replacement**: The direct object can become a pronoun:
   - *She finished her dissertation.* → *She finished **it**.*

3. **Passive transformation**: Direct objects can become passive subjects:
   - *Lightning struck the oak.* → *The oak was struck by lightning.*

### Diagram: Transitive Pattern

![Tree diagram showing transitive sentence](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-12-transitive-simple.png)

*Figure 12.7: A transitive sentence. The verb phrase contains both the verb and its direct object.*

![Tree diagram showing transitive with pronoun object](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-12-transitive-pro.png)

*Figure 12.8: A transitive sentence with a pronoun as direct object.*

### Verbs That Are Often Transitive

*accomplish, believe, bring, complete, create, destroy, discover, enjoy, find, hit, imagine, love, make, need, prefer, read, want, write*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the direct object:
*The documentary challenged my assumptions.*
*(Answer: "my assumptions")*

---

## 13.7 Pattern 5: Ditransitive (IO + DO)

### Structure: Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + Direct Object

Some transitive verbs can take two objects: an **indirect object** (the recipient or beneficiary) followed by a **direct object** (the thing transferred).

### Examples

| Subject | Verb | Indirect Object | Direct Object |
|---------|------|-----------------|---------------|
| The librarian | handed | me | a book |
| She | told | the children | a story |
| The company | offered | employees | free parking |
| I | owe | you | an apology |
| The chef | made | us | a special dessert |

### Identifying Indirect Objects

1. **To/For paraphrase**: You can rephrase with "to" or "for":
   - *The librarian handed me a book.* → *The librarian handed a book **to me**.*
   - *The chef made us a dessert.* → *The chef made a dessert **for us**.*

2. **Order matters**: IO comes before DO:
   - *She told the children a story.* (IO + DO)
   - *She told a story to the children.* (DO + PP—different structure)

### Diagram: Ditransitive (IO + DO)

![Tree diagram showing ditransitive with IO and DO](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-12-ditransitive.png)

*Figure 12.9: A ditransitive sentence with indirect object and direct object. The IO receives the DO.*

### Common Ditransitive Verbs

*award, bring, buy, cook, give, grant, hand, lend, make, offer, owe, pass, pay, promise, read, sell, send, show, teach, tell, throw, write*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify IO and DO:
*The professor assigned the class a challenging problem.*
*(IO: "the class"; DO: "a challenging problem")*

---

## 13.8 Pattern 6: Ditransitive (DO + OC)

### Structure: Subject + Verb + Direct Object + Object Complement

Some verbs take a direct object followed by an **object complement**—a word or phrase that describes or identifies the direct object.

### Examples

| Subject | Verb | Direct Object | Object Complement | OC Type |
|---------|------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| The jury | found | her | guilty | AdjP |
| Critics | called | the film | a masterpiece | NP |
| The heat | made | everyone | irritable | AdjP |
| They | elected | her | president | NP |
| I | consider | the matter | closed | AdjP |

### Distinguishing Pattern 5 from Pattern 6

**Pattern 5 (IO + DO)**: The two NPs refer to *different* things:
- *She gave **Marcus** **a book**.* (Marcus ≠ book)

**Pattern 6 (DO + OC)**: The complement describes or equals the DO:
- *They elected **her** **president**.* (her = president)
- *Critics called **the film** **a masterpiece**.* (film = masterpiece)

### Object Complement Types

**Adjective Phrase**: Describes the direct object
- *The news made her **anxious**.*
- *We painted the room **bright yellow**.*

**Noun Phrase**: Identifies or renames the direct object
- *The committee appointed him **treasurer**.*
- *They named their daughter **Sophia**.*

### Common DO + OC Verbs

*appoint, believe, call, consider, declare, deem, designate, elect, find, keep, label, leave, make, name, paint, prove, render, think*

### Check Your Understanding

Is this Pattern 5 or Pattern 6?
*The board appointed her chief financial officer.*
*(Pattern 6—"her" and "chief financial officer" refer to the same person)*

---

## 13.9 A Systematic Approach to Pattern Identification

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find the main verb** (not auxiliaries like *has*, *will*, *been*)

2. **Identify the subject** (the NP before the verb)

3. **Set aside adverbials** (time, place, manner, reason phrases—these don't affect pattern)

4. **Check for *be* first** → If yes, Pattern 2 (Copular Be)

5. **Apply the *be* substitution test** → If it works, Pattern 3 (Linking)

6. **Examine what follows the verb**:
   - Nothing → Pattern 1 (Intransitive)
   - One NP → Pattern 4 (Transitive)
   - Two NPs or NP + AdjP → Continue to step 7

7. **For two elements after the verb, ask**: Do they refer to the same thing?
   - Same thing → Pattern 6 (DO + OC)
   - Different things → Pattern 5 (IO + DO)

### Worked Example

**Sentence**: *On Tuesday, the committee unanimously declared the proposal inadequate.*

1. Main verb: *declared*
2. Subject: *the committee*
3. Adverbials: *On Tuesday* (time), *unanimously* (manner)—set aside
4. Is it *be*? No
5. *Be* substitution: *The proposal was inadequate* ✓—but "declare" isn't linking
6. What follows verb: *the proposal* (NP) + *inadequate* (AdjP)
7. Same thing? Yes—the proposal is described as inadequate

**Answer: Pattern 6 (DO + OC)**

## 13.10 Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Adverbials change the pattern"

**Wrong**: *The birds sang beautifully in the garden.* = Pattern 4?

**Right**: Adverbials don't affect pattern. Remove them: *The birds sang.* = Pattern 1 (Intransitive)

### Misconception 2: "A prepositional phrase after the verb means transitive"

**Wrong**: *She walked to the store.* = Transitive with "the store" as object?

**Right**: "To the store" is a PP functioning as adverbial. Pattern 1 (Intransitive)

### Misconception 3: "Long sentences must be complex patterns"

**Wrong**: A long sentence must be Pattern 5 or 6?

**Right**: Length doesn't determine pattern. *The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya who had trained for years finally collapsed at the finish line* is still Pattern 1 (Intransitive).

### Misconception 4: "Linking verbs are always linking"

**Wrong**: "Feel" is always linking?

**Right**: Many verbs can be linking OR transitive depending on context:
- *The silk **feels** smooth.* (Pattern 3—linking)
- *She **felt** the bump on her head.* (Pattern 4—transitive)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Pattern Identification

Identify the sentence pattern (1-6).

1. *The old lighthouse still stands.*
2. *Her brother became an architect.*
3. *The earthquake destroyed several bridges.*
4. *The witness seemed nervous.*
5. *The organization awarded her a scholarship.*
6. *Everyone considers the project a success.*
7. *The medicine tasted bitter.*
8. *Ice melts.*
9. *The principal named him valedictorian.*
10. *My aunt sent me a birthday card.*

### Exercise 2: Handling Adverbials

First set aside adverbials, then identify the pattern.

1. *Every morning, the neighbor's rooster crows loudly.*
2. *In the dusty attic, the old photographs were surprisingly well-preserved.*
3. *Yesterday afternoon, someone anonymously donated a million dollars to the hospital.*
4. *Without hesitation, the rescue team declared the building unsafe.*
5. *On special occasions, my grandmother always baked us her famous apple pie.*

### Exercise 3: Labeling Elements

For each sentence, label: Subject, Verb, and any complements (DO, IO, SC, OC).

1. *The unexpected announcement shocked everyone.*
2. *The protesters remained peaceful throughout the demonstration.*
3. *My neighbor offered me her extra tickets.*
4. *The critics unanimously pronounced the performance brilliant.*
5. *Something strange happened last night.*

### Exercise 4: Creating Sentences

Write one original sentence for each pattern:

1. Intransitive
2. Copular *be* with NP complement
3. Linking verb with AdjP complement
4. Transitive
5. Ditransitive (IO + DO)
6. Ditransitive (DO + OC)

### Exercise 5: Ambiguous Verbs

For each verb, write two sentences showing it in different patterns.

1. *grow* (linking vs. transitive)
2. *keep* (transitive vs. DO + OC)
3. *make* (transitive vs. DO + OC vs. IO + DO)

## Application: Analyzing Real Text

### Activity 1: Text Analysis

Find a paragraph from a news article or essay. Identify the pattern of each sentence. Questions to consider:
- Which pattern appears most frequently?
- Are any patterns absent?
- Do pattern choices relate to the content or style?

### Activity 2: Pattern Revision

Take three transitive sentences and revise them to be intransitive. Then revise three intransitive sentences to be transitive. What changes are necessary? What information is gained or lost?

**Example**:
- Transitive: *The chef prepared the meal.* → Intransitive: *The chef worked.*
- Intransitive: *The child laughed.* → Transitive: *The child enjoyed the joke.*

---

## Chapter Summary

- English sentences follow six basic patterns determined by verb type and required elements.
- **Pattern 1 (Intransitive)**: Subject + Verb. No complement needed.
- **Pattern 2 (Copular be)**: Subject + be + Subject Complement. *Be* links subject to description.
- **Pattern 3 (Linking)**: Subject + Linking Verb + SC. Other verbs that work like *be*.
- **Pattern 4 (Transitive)**: Subject + Verb + Direct Object. Action passes to an object.
- **Pattern 5 (IO + DO)**: Subject + Verb + Indirect Object + DO. Recipient + thing given.
- **Pattern 6 (DO + OC)**: Subject + Verb + DO + Object Complement. Object + its description.
- Adverbials can appear in any pattern but don't change the pattern classification.
- Many verbs can appear in multiple patterns depending on how they're used.

**Copular verb**: A form of *be* that links subject to complement; also called "copula."

**Direct object**: The noun phrase that receives the action of a transitive verb.

**Ditransitive verb**: A verb requiring two objects (IO + DO) or an object plus complement (DO + OC).

**Indirect object**: The recipient or beneficiary in a ditransitive sentence; can be paraphrased with "to" or "for."

**Intransitive verb**: A verb that requires only a subject to form a complete sentence.

**Linking verb**: A verb that connects the subject to a complement describing it; can be replaced by *be*.

**Object complement**: A word or phrase that describes or identifies the direct object.

**Sentence pattern**: The structural template a sentence follows based on verb type and required elements.

**Subject complement**: A word or phrase following a copular or linking verb that describes or identifies the subject.

**Transitive verb**: A verb requiring a direct object to complete its meaning.
