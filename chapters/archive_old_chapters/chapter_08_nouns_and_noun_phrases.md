## 8.1 Identifying Nouns

Chapter 5 introduced nouns as an open-class part of speech. Now we examine them in detail, focusing on the tests that reliably identify nouns and the phrases they head.

### Morphological Tests (Form)

Morphological tests examine the word itself—what forms it can take.

**Test 1: Plural formation**

Most nouns can be made plural:
- *book* → *books*
- *child* → *children*
- *analysis* → *analyses*

Even abstract nouns can often be pluralized:
- *happiness* → *happinesses* (rare, but possible: "the small happinesses of daily life")
- *decision* → *decisions*

**Test 2: Possessive formation**

Nouns can take possessive marking:
- *the dog's tail*
- *Maria's book*
- *the committee's decision*

**Morphological noun markers (derivational suffixes):**

Certain suffixes typically create nouns:

| Suffix | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| *-tion/-sion* | *action*, *decision*, *exception*, *conclusion* |
| *-ness* | *happiness*, *awkwardness*, *cleverness* |
| *-ity* | *curiosity*, *generosity*, *serendipity*, *ambiguity* |
| *-ment* | *government*, *amazement*, *establishment* |
| *-er/-or* | *teacher*, *actor*, *writer*, *advisor* |
| *-ance/-ence* | *importance*, *reference*, *assistance* |

### Syntactic Tests (Function)

Syntactic tests examine how the word behaves in sentences.

**Test 1: Determiner test**

Nouns can follow determiners (*a*, *the*, *this*, *my*, *every*):
- *the **proposal***
- *a **happiness***
- *every **decision***

**Test 2: Adjective modification test**

Nouns can be modified by adjectives:
- *the **new** proposal*
- *a **great** happiness*
- *every **important** decision*

**Test 3: Pronoun replacement test**

Noun phrases (the noun plus its modifiers) can be replaced by pronouns:
- *The new proposal* → *It*
- *My older brother* → *He*
- *Those expensive books* → *They*

**Test 4: Subject/object test**

Nouns can function as subjects or objects:
- Subject: ***Books** are expensive.*
- Direct object: *I bought **books**.*
- Object of preposition: *I learned from **books**.*

### Practice: Applying the Tests

Is *expectation* a noun?

**Morphological tests:**
- Plural: *expectations* ✓
- Possessive: *the expectation's fulfillment* ✓
- Has noun suffix *-tion* ✓

**Syntactic tests:**
- Follows determiner: *the expectation* ✓
- Takes adjective: *the great expectation* ✓
- Replaces with pronoun: *The expectation grew* → *It grew* ✓

Result: *expectation* is definitely a noun.

## 8.2 Types of Nouns

Nouns can be classified in several ways that affect their grammatical behavior.

### Common vs. Proper Nouns

**Common nouns** name general classes of entities:
- *city*, *teacher*, *book*, *idea*

**Proper nouns** name specific, unique entities:
- *Chicago*, *Professor Smith*, *The Great Gatsby*

Proper nouns are typically capitalized and often don't take determiners:
- *Chicago is large.* (not ~~*The Chicago is large.*~~)
- *Professor Smith teaches grammar.*

### Count vs. Mass Nouns

**Count nouns** refer to discrete, countable entities:
- *book/books*, *idea/ideas*, *student/students*
- Can be pluralized
- Can take *a/an* and numbers: *a book*, *three ideas*

**Mass nouns** (also called non-count nouns) refer to undifferentiated substances or abstractions:
- *water*, *rice*, *information*, *furniture*, *advice*
- Cannot be pluralized: ~~*informations*~~, ~~*furnitures*~~
- Cannot take *a/an* or numbers directly: ~~*a furniture*~~, ~~*three advices*~~
- Take quantifiers: *some water*, *much information*, *a piece of furniture*

**Some nouns can be both**, with different meanings:
- *I love **coffee**.* (mass—the substance)
- *I'll have **two coffees**.* (count—two cups/servings)
- *She has **experience**.* (mass—general)
- *She had **many experiences** abroad.* (count—specific events)

---

## 8.3 Noun Phrase Structure

A **noun phrase (NP)** is a group of words built around a noun. The noun is the **head**—the essential element that determines the phrase's category and core meaning.

### Basic NP Structure

A full noun phrase can include:

```
(Determiner) + (Pre-modifiers) + HEAD NOUN + (Post-modifiers/Complements)
```

**Examples:**

| Determiner | Pre-modifiers | Head | Post-modifiers |
|------------|---------------|------|----------------|
| the | young | artist | from Paris |
| my | favorite old | books | about history |
| those | three large red | boxes | in the corner |
| | | students | who study hard |

Only the head is required; everything else is optional:
- ***Books** are expensive.* (just the head)
- *The **books** are expensive.* (determiner + head)
- *The old **books** are expensive.* (determiner + pre-modifier + head)
- *The old **books** on the shelf are expensive.* (all elements)

### Determiners in Detail

Determiners introduce noun phrases and help specify the reference. They answer questions like "which one?" or "how many?"

**Articles:**
- Definite: *the* (specific, known to hearer)
- Indefinite: *a*, *an* (non-specific, introduced for first time)

**Demonstratives:**
- Near: *this*, *these*
- Far: *that*, *those*

**Possessives:**
- Pronouns: *my*, *your*, *his*, *her*, *its*, *our*, *their*
- Noun + *'s*: *John's*, *the dog's*, *the government's*

**Quantifiers:**
- Universal: *all*, *every*, *each*, *both*
- Existential: *some*, *any*, *no*
- Degree: *many*, *much*, *few*, *little*, *several*

**Numbers:**
- Cardinal: *one*, *two*, *three*
- Ordinal: *first*, *second*, *third*

**Determiner combinations:**

Some determiners can co-occur:
- *all the students* (quantifier + article)
- *both my parents* (quantifier + possessive)
- *the first three chapters* (article + ordinal + cardinal)

But most determiners are mutually exclusive:
- ~~*the my book*~~
- ~~*this the student*~~

### Pre-modifiers

**Pre-modifiers** come before the head noun. They are typically adjectives or nouns functioning as modifiers.

**Adjectives:**
- *the **tall** man*
- *a **beautiful old Italian** painting*

**Order of adjectives** (when multiple adjectives occur):

Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose

- *a **beautiful big old rectangular brown Italian wooden writing** desk*

You don't need to memorize this order—native speakers intuit it—but it explains why some orderings sound wrong:
- *the big red ball* ✓
- *the red big ball* ✗

**Nouns as pre-modifiers:**
- *a **coffee** table* (table for coffee)
- *the **government** report* (report by government)
- *a **brick** house* (house made of brick)

### Post-modifiers

**Post-modifiers** come after the head noun. They include prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and other structures.

**Prepositional phrases:**
- *the man **in the hat***
- *a book **about linguistics***
- *students **from Pueblo***

**Relative clauses:**
- *the book **that I read***
- *students **who study hard***
- *the man **whose car was stolen***

**Adjective phrases (after linking verbs or in special positions):**
- *something **interesting***
- *the people **present***

**Infinitive phrases:**
- *the decision **to leave***
- *a book **to read***

**Participial phrases:**
- *the man **standing in the corner***
- *the letter **written by Maria***

## 8.4 Functions of Noun Phrases

Noun phrases can serve many functions in sentences:

### Subject

The NP about which something is predicated:
- ***The young artist** painted beautiful landscapes.*
- ***Three ambitious students from Pueblo** study in the library.*

### Direct Object

The NP that receives the action of the verb:
- *She read **the book**.*
- *I gave **my friend** a present.*

### Indirect Object

The NP that receives the direct object:
- *I gave **my friend** a present.*
- *She told **the students** a story.*

### Subject Complement

The NP that describes or identifies the subject (after linking verbs):
- *John is **a teacher**.*
- *She became **the president**.*

### Object Complement

The NP that describes or identifies the object:
- *They elected her **president**.*
- *We consider him **a genius**.*

### Object of Preposition

The NP that follows a preposition:
- *I sat **near the window**.*
- *She spoke **to the students**.*

## Form and Function Tests

### Identifying Noun Phrases

To identify an NP:

1. **Find the head noun** using noun tests
2. **Look left for determiners and pre-modifiers**
3. **Look right for post-modifiers**
4. **Test with pronoun replacement**: Can the whole unit be replaced by a pronoun?

### Example Analysis

*The ambitious students from Pueblo study hard.*

**Finding the NP:**
- Head noun: *students* (plural, follows determiner)
- Determiner: *the*
- Pre-modifier: *ambitious* (adjective)
- Post-modifier: *from Pueblo* (prepositional phrase)
- Complete NP: *The ambitious students from Pueblo*
- Pronoun test: *They study hard.* ✓

**Diagramming the NP:**

## Chapter Summary

- **Nouns** are identified through morphological tests (plural, possessive, derivational suffixes) and syntactic tests (follows determiner, takes adjective, replaced by pronoun).
- Nouns are classified as **common/proper** and **count/mass**, affecting their grammatical behavior.
- A **noun phrase** consists of a head noun with optional determiners, pre-modifiers, and post-modifiers.
- **Determiners** introduce NPs and include articles, demonstratives, possessives, quantifiers, and numbers.
- **Pre-modifiers** (adjectives, nouns) appear before the head; **post-modifiers** (PPs, relative clauses) appear after.
- Noun phrases function as subjects, objects, complements, and objects of prepositions.
- Identifying NPs requires finding the head noun, then looking for its dependents.

## Glossary

**Complement**: An element that completes the meaning of a head; in NPs, this typically refers to post-modifiers.

**Count noun**: A noun that refers to discrete entities and can be pluralized and used with *a/an* and numbers.

**Determiner**: A closed-class word that introduces a noun phrase and specifies reference (articles, demonstratives, possessives, quantifiers).

**Head**: The central, obligatory element of a phrase that determines its category.

**Mass noun**: A noun that refers to undifferentiated substances or abstractions and cannot be pluralized directly.

**Noun phrase (NP)**: A phrase with a noun as its head, including any determiners, modifiers, and complements.

**Post-modifier**: A modifier that follows the head noun (prepositional phrases, relative clauses, etc.).

**Pre-modifier**: A modifier that precedes the head noun (adjectives, nouns).

**Proper noun**: A noun naming a specific, unique entity; typically capitalized and often without determiners.
