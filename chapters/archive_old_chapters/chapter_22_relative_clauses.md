## 22.1 What Are Relative Clauses?

A **relative clause** is a dependent clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase, providing additional information about it. The noun being modified is called the **antecedent**.

Consider these examples:

- *The musician **who performed last night** received a standing ovation.*
- *The novel **that I finished yesterday** had an unexpected ending.*
- *The café **where we first met** closed last month.*

In each sentence, the relative clause (in bold) tells us more about the antecedent (musician, novel, café).

### Why Relative Clauses Matter

Relative clauses allow writers to:
- Combine related ideas efficiently
- Add essential identifying information
- Include supplementary details
- Create complex, nuanced sentences

Without relative clauses, we'd need separate sentences:

**Without relative clause**: *I adopted a cat. The cat had been abandoned.*
**With relative clause**: *I adopted a cat **that had been abandoned**.*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the relative clause and its antecedent: *The trail that winds through the forest offers spectacular views.*

*(Answer: Relative clause: "that winds through the forest"; Antecedent: "trail")*

## 22.2 Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses and connect them to their antecedents. Different pronouns serve different functions.

### The Relative Pronoun System

| Pronoun | Refers To | Grammatical Function |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **who** | people | subject |
| **whom** | people | object (formal) |
| **which** | things, animals | subject or object |
| **that** | people or things | subject or object (restrictive only) |
| **whose** | people, things, animals | possession |

### Who vs. Whom

**Who** functions as the subject of the relative clause:
- *The architect **who designed** this building won several awards.*
- *Athletes **who train consistently** improve their performance.*
- *The witness **who saw** the accident gave a statement.*

**Whom** functions as the object (formal usage):
- *The candidate **whom the committee selected** starts Monday.*
- *The author **whom I most admire** published a new book.*
- *The teacher **whom we thanked** appreciated our gratitude.*

**Testing tip**: Replace the pronoun with *he/she* or *him/her*. If *he/she* works, use *who*; if *him/her* works, use *whom*.

- *[He/Him] designed this building.* → *He* works → use *who*
- *The committee selected [he/him].* → *Him* works → use *whom*

### Which vs. That

**Which** refers to things and can introduce both restrictive and non-restrictive clauses:
- *The car **which I purchased** runs efficiently.* (restrictive)
- *This camera, **which I bought in Japan,** takes excellent photos.* (non-restrictive)

**That** refers to people or things but only in restrictive clauses:
- *The book **that changed my perspective** was about mindfulness.*
- *The teacher **that inspired me most** taught physics.*

### Whose

**Whose** indicates possession and can refer to people or things:
- *The sculptor **whose work** fills the gallery studied in Florence.*
- *The tree **whose branches** touch the roof needs trimming.*
- *The company **whose products** I recommend maintains high standards.*

### Check Your Understanding

Choose the correct pronoun: *The candidate _____ we interviewed yesterday has excellent qualifications.*

*(Answer: "whom" or "that" — because the pronoun is the object of "interviewed")*

---

## 22.3 Relative Adverbs

**Relative adverbs** introduce relative clauses that provide information about place, time, or reason.

| Adverb | Refers To | Equivalent |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **where** | place | at which, in which |
| **when** | time | at which, on which |
| **why** | reason | for which |

### Where

- *The park **where children play** has been renovated.*
- *She returned to the town **where she grew up**.*
- *The office **where I work** occupies the top floor.*

**Alternative with preposition + which**:
- *The town **in which she grew up**...*
- *The office **at which I work**...*

### When

- *The decade **when jazz flourished** produced legendary musicians.*
- *I remember the summer **when we traveled abroad**.*
- *The period **when dinosaurs roamed** lasted millions of years.*

**Alternative**:
- *The summer **during which we traveled abroad**...*

### Why

- *The reason **why she resigned** remains unclear.*
- *I understand the reasons **why you hesitated**.*

**Note**: *Why* can often be omitted:
- *The reason **(why)** she resigned remains unclear.*

### Check Your Understanding

Complete with the appropriate relative adverb: *This is the restaurant _____ they serve authentic Thai cuisine.*

*(Answer: "where")*

## 22.4 Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive Clauses

This distinction is fundamental to understanding relative clauses and affects meaning, punctuation, and word choice.

### Restrictive (Defining) Clauses

**Restrictive clauses** provide essential information that identifies or defines which person or thing is meant. Without this information, the sentence would be ambiguous or incomplete.

**No commas** surround restrictive clauses:

- *Students **who submit late assignments** receive grade penalties.*
  (Only those students who submit late—not all students)

- *The jacket **that I borrowed** belongs to my roommate.*
  (That specific jacket, not just any jacket)

- *Musicians **who practice daily** develop greater skill.*
  (Specifically those who practice daily)

### Non-Restrictive (Non-Defining) Clauses

**Non-restrictive clauses** provide additional, non-essential information. The sentence would still be complete and clear without them. They function like parenthetical comments.

**Commas** set off non-restrictive clauses:

- *My grandmother, **who turns ninety tomorrow,** still gardens daily.*
  (I have only one grandmother; the clause adds information)

- *Mount Everest, **which rises 29,032 feet,** attracts climbers worldwide.*
  (There's only one Mount Everest; the height is additional info)

- *Professor Chen, **whom I met at the conference,** offered helpful advice.*
  (Professor Chen is already identified; the clause adds context)

### Visual Representation

The following diagram illustrates how relative clauses attach to and modify noun phrases within sentence structure:

![Relative clause attachment in sentence structure](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-22-relative.png)

### Key Differences Summarized

| Feature | Restrictive | Non-Restrictive |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Function** | Identifies/defines which one | Adds extra information |
| **Punctuation** | No commas | Commas required |
| **That usage** | *That* acceptable | *That* NOT used |
| **Pronoun omission** | Object pronoun omittable | Pronoun required |
| **Removable?** | Changes/obscures meaning | Meaning clear without it |

### Meaning Changes with Punctuation

Punctuation can dramatically change meaning:

**Restrictive**: *The volunteers who arrived early set up the equipment.*
(Only those volunteers who arrived early—others did not help set up)

**Non-restrictive**: *The volunteers, who arrived early, set up the equipment.*
(All the volunteers arrived early, and they all helped set up)

### Check Your Understanding

Why do these sentences mean different things?
- *My sister who lives in Seattle visited last week.*
- *My sister, who lives in Seattle, visited last week.*

*(Answer: The first implies multiple sisters—identifying which one. The second implies one sister—adding information about where she lives.)*

## 22.5 Subject, Object, and Possessive Relative Clauses

The relative pronoun can serve different grammatical functions within its clause.

### Subject Relative Clauses

The relative pronoun functions as the **subject** of the relative clause:

- *The novelist **who won the prize** delivered an inspiring speech.*
  (*who* is subject of *won*)

- *The policy **that addresses climate change** passed unanimously.*
  (*that* is subject of *addresses*)

- *The cottage **which overlooks the lake** has been in my family for generations.*
  (*which* is subject of *overlooks*)

**The relative pronoun cannot be omitted** in subject relative clauses.

### Object Relative Clauses

The relative pronoun functions as the **object** of the verb in the relative clause:

- *The documentary **(that/which) I watched** changed my perspective.*
  (*that/which* is object of *watched*)

- *The instructor **(whom/that) the students admire** retired last year.*
  (*whom/that* is object of *admire*)

- *The tools **(that/which) we need** are in the shed.*
  (*that/which* is object of *need*)

**The relative pronoun can often be omitted** in restrictive object clauses, creating a **contact clause**:

- *The documentary **I watched** changed my perspective.*
- *The instructor **the students admire** retired last year.*
- *The tools **we need** are in the shed.*

### Object of Preposition

When the relative pronoun is the object of a preposition, you have two options:

**Pied-piping** (formal—preposition moves with the pronoun):
- *The colleague **with whom I collaborate** is exceptionally talented.*
- *The topic **about which she spoke** generated much discussion.*
- *The conditions **under which they work** are challenging.*

**Stranded preposition** (informal—preposition stays at end):
- *The colleague **(whom/that) I collaborate with** is exceptionally talented.*
- *The topic **(that/which) she spoke about** generated much discussion.*
- *The conditions **(that/which) they work under** are challenging.*

### Possessive Relative Clauses

**Whose** indicates that the antecedent possesses something within the relative clause:

- *The artist **whose paintings** hang in the gallery studied in Paris.*
  (The artist's paintings)

- *The company **whose reputation** precedes it opened a local branch.*
  (The company's reputation)

- *The house **whose roof** we repaired belongs to my aunt.*
  (The house's roof)

**Note**: *Whose* can refer to things as well as people:
- *The building **whose foundation** cracked requires structural repair.*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the function of the relative pronoun in each:
1. *The composer who wrote this symphony died young.*
2. *The symphony that she performed received great acclaim.*

*(Answer: 1. "who" = subject of "wrote"; 2. "that" = object of "performed")*

---

## 22.6 Reducing Relative Clauses

Full relative clauses can often be **reduced** to shorter structures, creating more concise sentences.

### Reduction to Present Participle Phrases

**Relative clause with active verb** → **Present participle phrase**

- *Students **who study** abroad gain valuable experience.*
  → *Students **studying** abroad gain valuable experience.*

- *The river **that flows** through the valley provides irrigation.*
  → *The river **flowing** through the valley provides irrigation.*

- *Anyone **who wishes** to participate should register.*
  → *Anyone **wishing** to participate should register.*

**Relative clause with progressive** → **Present participle phrase**

- *The children **who are playing** in the yard seem happy.*
  → *The children **playing** in the yard seem happy.*

- *The man **who is standing** by the door is the manager.*
  → *The man **standing** by the door is the manager.*

### Reduction to Past Participle Phrases

**Relative clause with passive verb** → **Past participle phrase**

- *The evidence **that was collected** at the scene proved crucial.*
  → *The evidence **collected** at the scene proved crucial.*

- *The book **that was written** in 1845 remains influential.*
  → *The book **written** in 1845 remains influential.*

- *Items **that are purchased** online can be returned within thirty days.*
  → *Items **purchased** online can be returned within thirty days.*

### Reduction to Adjective Phrases

**Relative clause with *be* + adjective** → **Adjective (phrase)**

- *Students **who are eligible** should apply.*
  → ***Eligible** students should apply.*

- *Methods **that are effective** produce results.*
  → ***Effective** methods produce results.*

- *The options **that are available** include several colors.*
  → *The **available** options include several colors.*

### Reduction to Prepositional Phrases

**Relative clause with *be* + prepositional phrase** → **Prepositional phrase**

- *The cat **that is on the roof** looks frightened.*
  → *The cat **on the roof** looks frightened.*

- *The documents **that are in the folder** need signatures.*
  → *The documents **in the folder** need signatures.*

### Reduction to Infinitive Phrases

**Relative clause expressing purpose or obligation** → **Infinitive phrase**

- *The first person **who arrived** registered the group.*
  → *The first person **to arrive** registered the group.*

- *She needs a pen **that she can write with**.*
  → *She needs a pen **to write with**.*

- *There's nothing **that we should worry about**.*
  → *There's nothing **to worry about**.*

### When Reduction Is Not Possible

Not all relative clauses can be reduced:

- When the relative pronoun is object: *The book **that I read*** ≠ *The book **reading***
- When the verb is stative: *The person **who knows** the answer* (not reducible easily)
- When ambiguity would result

### Check Your Understanding

Reduce this relative clause: *The candidates who were selected for interviews will be notified.*

*(Answer: "The candidates selected for interviews will be notified.")*

## 22.7 Common Errors and Misconceptions

### Error 1: Double Subject

**Incorrect**: *The student **who she** passed the exam celebrated.*
**Correct**: *The student **who** passed the exam celebrated.*

The relative pronoun itself serves as the subject; adding another pronoun creates redundancy.

### Error 2: Wrong Case (Who vs. Whom)

**Overly informal**: *The teacher **who** I spoke with...*
**Standard/formal**: *The teacher **whom** I spoke with...* or *The teacher **with whom** I spoke...*

In formal writing, use *whom* when the pronoun is an object.

### Error 3: That in Non-Restrictive Clauses

**Incorrect**: *Paris, **that** is the capital of France, attracts millions of tourists.*
**Correct**: *Paris, **which** is the capital of France, attracts millions of tourists.*

Use *which* (not *that*) in non-restrictive clauses.

### Error 4: Comma Errors

**Incorrect**: *Students, who cheat, will be expelled.* (if meaning "only those who cheat")
**Correct**: *Students who cheat will be expelled.*

**Incorrect**: *My mother who lives in Portland visited us.* (if you have only one mother)
**Correct**: *My mother, who lives in Portland, visited us.*

### Error 5: Dangling or Misplaced Relative Clauses

**Ambiguous**: *She gave the dog to her friend that had fleas.*
(Did the friend or the dog have fleas?)

**Clear**: *She gave her friend the dog that had fleas.*
or *She gave the dog, which had fleas, to her friend.*

### Misconception: "Never End a Sentence with a Preposition"

**Myth**: Sentences shouldn't end with prepositions, so always use pied-piping.

**Reality**: Stranded prepositions are natural in English, especially in speech and informal writing:
- Natural: *That's the book I was telling you **about**.*
- Formal but acceptable: *That's the book **about which** I was telling you.*

Extreme pied-piping sounds stilted: *That is the book up with which I will not put.* (famously attributed to Winston Churchill as satire)

### Misconception: "That is Only for Things"

**Myth**: Use *that* only for things; use *who* for people.

**Reality**: *That* can refer to people in restrictive clauses:
- *The first person **that** arrives should unlock the door.* (acceptable)
- *Anyone **that** disagrees may speak now.* (acceptable)

However, *who* is often preferred for people, especially when emphasizing humanity.

### Check Your Understanding

What's wrong with this sentence? *My brother, that lives in Texas, is visiting.*

*(Answer: Non-restrictive clauses require "which" or "who," not "that." Correct: "My brother, who lives in Texas, is visiting.")*

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identify Relative Clauses and Types

Identify the relative clause, its antecedent, and whether it's restrictive (R) or non-restrictive (NR).

1. *The recipe that my grandmother shared has been in our family for generations.*
2. *The Nile River, which flows through northeastern Africa, is the longest river on Earth.*
3. *Athletes who compete in the Olympics train for years.*
4. *Dr. Martinez, whom I met at the symposium, specializes in marine biology.*
5. *The reason why attendance dropped remains unclear.*
6. *The house where I spent my childhood was recently demolished.*
7. *The Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I, was signed in 1919.*
8. *Employees who complete the training receive a certificate.*

### Exercise 2: Combine Sentences with Relative Clauses

Combine each pair using a relative clause. Decide whether it should be restrictive or non-restrictive.

1. *I visited a museum. The museum displays contemporary art.*
2. *The author won several awards. I admire the author.*
3. *We stayed at a hotel. The hotel overlooks the ocean.*
4. *My colleague introduced me to her supervisor. Her supervisor manages the research division.*
5. *The documentary examines climate change. The documentary premiered last month.*

### Exercise 3: Choose the Correct Relative Pronoun

Fill in the blank with the most appropriate relative pronoun or adverb.

1. *The scientist _______ discovered this phenomenon published her findings last year.*
2. *The café _______ we usually meet is closed for renovations.*
3. *She's the colleague _______ advice I value most.*
4. *Is this the moment _______ everything changed?*
5. *The candidate _______ we interviewed seemed highly qualified.*
6. *The organization, _______ mission focuses on literacy, received a major grant.*
7. *The reason _______ the project failed was poor planning.*
8. *Anyone _______ wishes to volunteer should sign up by Friday.*

### Exercise 4: Reduce Relative Clauses

Reduce each relative clause to a participial phrase, adjective, or prepositional phrase.

1. *The packages that were delivered this morning are on your desk.*
2. *Students who are interested in the program should attend the information session.*
3. *The novel that was published last year became a bestseller.*
4. *The car that is parked in the driveway belongs to my neighbor.*
5. *People who work in healthcare deserve our appreciation.*
6. *The files that are in the cabinet need to be organized.*

### Exercise 5: Correct the Errors

Each sentence contains an error related to relative clauses. Identify and correct it.

1. *The project leader, that we met yesterday, outlined the timeline.*
2. *The engineer who we consulted him recommended a different approach.*
3. *My father who is retired enjoys woodworking.*
4. *The restaurant which I recommended it has excellent reviews.*
5. *Students, who submit late assignments, will lose points.*
6. *That's the author who's books I've been reading.*

### Exercise 6: Punctuate Correctly

Add commas where necessary. Some sentences may need no changes.

1. *The software that we purchased last month has already become essential.*
2. *Our CEO who founded the company in 1998 announced her retirement.*
3. *Vehicles that exceed the speed limit will be photographed.*
4. *The Colosseum which was built nearly 2000 years ago still stands in Rome.*
5. *Researchers who study climate patterns have noted alarming trends.*
6. *Dr. Thompson whose research focuses on genetics received the grant.*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Relative Clause Analysis

Find a paragraph from a news article or academic text. Identify all relative clauses and analyze:
- What type is each (restrictive or non-restrictive)?
- What function does the relative pronoun serve (subject, object, possessive)?
- Could any be reduced? If so, how?

### Activity 2: Writing with Variety

Write a paragraph (5-7 sentences) describing a place you've visited. Include:
- At least two restrictive relative clauses
- At least one non-restrictive relative clause
- At least one relative clause with a relative adverb (where, when)
- At least one reduced relative clause

### Activity 3: Formal vs. Informal Style

Rewrite these informal sentences in a more formal style, adjusting relative clause structure:
1. *That's the professor I was talking about.*
2. *There's the house we used to live in.*
3. *Who's the person you borrowed the book from?*

Then rewrite these formal sentences more informally:
1. *The individual with whom I corresponded has not yet replied.*
2. *The circumstances under which the decision was made remain confidential.*

## Chapter Summary

- **Relative clauses** are dependent clauses that modify nouns, introduced by relative pronouns (*who, whom, which, that, whose*) or relative adverbs (*where, when, why*).

- **Restrictive clauses** define or identify which noun is meant; they use no commas and allow *that*.

- **Non-restrictive clauses** add extra information about an already-identified noun; they require commas and use *which* (not *that*) for things.

- **Relative pronouns** function as subjects, objects, or possessives within their clauses; object pronouns can often be omitted in restrictive clauses.

- **Relative clauses can be reduced** to participial phrases, adjectives, or prepositional phrases for conciseness.

- **Common errors** include double subjects, wrong pronoun case, using *that* in non-restrictive clauses, and punctuation mistakes.
