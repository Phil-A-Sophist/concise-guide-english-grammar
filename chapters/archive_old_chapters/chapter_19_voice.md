## 19.1 What Is Voice?

**Voice** is a grammatical category that describes the relationship between the subject of a sentence and the action expressed by the verb. English has two primary voices: active and passive.

### Active Voice

In **active voice**, the subject performs the action. The sentence structure flows naturally from actor to action to receiver:

- *The architect **designed** the building.*
- *Lightning **struck** the old oak tree.*
- *Our team **has completed** the analysis.*

The subject (architect, lightning, team) is the **agent**—the one doing the action.

### Passive Voice

In **passive voice**, the subject receives the action. The receiver becomes prominent, and the performer may be de-emphasized or omitted:

- *The building **was designed** by the architect.*
- *The old oak tree **was struck** by lightning.*
- *The analysis **has been completed**.*

The subject (building, tree, analysis) is the **patient**—the one affected by the action.

### Why Voice Matters

Voice affects:
- **Emphasis**: Which participant gets prominence?
- **Information flow**: What's the topic? What's new information?
- **Responsibility**: Is the agent identified or obscured?
- **Style**: Does the writing feel direct or formal?

## 19.2 Forming the Passive Voice

### The Basic Formula

**Passive = appropriate form of *be* + past participle**

The form of *be* carries tense and aspect; the main verb becomes a past participle.

### Passive in All Tenses and Aspects

| Tense/Aspect | Active | Passive |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Simple present | *writes* | *is written* |
| Simple past | *wrote* | *was written* |
| Present progressive | *is writing* | *is being written* |
| Past progressive | *was writing* | *was being written* |
| Present perfect | *has written* | *has been written* |
| Past perfect | *had written* | *had been written* |
| Future (will) | *will write* | *will be written* |
| Future (going to) | *is going to write* | *is going to be written* |
| Modal | *can write* | *can be written* |
| Modal perfect | *should have written* | *should have been written* |

### Examples Across Tenses

**Simple present**:
- Active: *The committee **reviews** applications weekly.*
- Passive: *Applications **are reviewed** weekly.*

**Simple past**:
- Active: *A falling branch **damaged** the roof.*
- Passive: *The roof **was damaged** by a falling branch.*

**Present progressive**:
- Active: *Workers **are renovating** the stadium.*
- Passive: *The stadium **is being renovated**.*

**Present perfect**:
- Active: *Scientists **have discovered** a new compound.*
- Passive: *A new compound **has been discovered**.*

**Modal**:
- Active: *We **can resolve** this issue.*
- Passive: *This issue **can be resolved**.*

### Check Your Understanding

Convert to passive: *The tornado destroyed several homes.*

*(Answer: Several homes were destroyed by the tornado.)*

## 19.3 Converting Between Active and Passive

### Active to Passive

1. Move the direct object to subject position
2. Add the appropriate form of *be* (matching the original tense/aspect)
3. Change the verb to past participle
4. (Optional) Add the original subject as a *by*-phrase

**Active**: *The jury **delivered** the verdict.*
- Object → Subject: *The verdict...*
- Add *be* (past): *The verdict **was**...*
- Past participle: *The verdict **was delivered**...*
- By-phrase (optional): *The verdict **was delivered** by the jury.*

### Passive to Active

1. Make the *by*-phrase subject (or supply one if missing)
2. Remove *be* and adjust tense
3. Change past participle to appropriate verb form
4. Make the passive subject the direct object

**Passive**: *The proposal **was rejected** by the board.*
- By-phrase → Subject: *The board...*
- Verb (past): *The board **rejected**...*
- Object: *The board **rejected** the proposal.*

### When Conversion Isn't Possible

Not all sentences can be converted:

**Intransitive verbs** have no object:
- *The child laughed.* → No passive (nothing to become subject)

**Some transitive verbs** resist passivization:
- *She **resembles** her mother.* → *?Her mother is resembled by her.* (unnatural)
- *The jar **holds** a liter.* → *?A liter is held by the jar.* (odd)

## 19.4 When to Use Passive Voice

### Agent Unknown or Irrelevant

When you don't know who performed the action, or it doesn't matter:

- *The window **was broken** sometime last night.* (who did it?)
- *The building **was constructed** in 1892.* (builders not important)
- *Penicillin **was discovered** in 1928.* (focus on discovery, not discoverer)

### Emphasizing the Receiver

When the patient is more important or newsworthy than the agent:

- *The ambassador **was assassinated** this morning.*
- *Three pedestrians **were injured** in the collision.*
- *The missing hiker **has been found**.*

### Maintaining Topic Continuity

When you want to keep the same topic as subject across sentences:

- *The manuscript arrived yesterday. It **was written** in the 14th century and **has been examined** by several scholars.*

Starting each sentence with "the manuscript/it" keeps the paragraph cohesive.

### Scientific and Technical Writing

Passive is traditional in scientific writing to focus on procedures and results rather than researchers:

- *The samples **were collected** from three sites.*
- *Temperature **was maintained** at 37°C throughout the experiment.*
- *The data **were analyzed** using SPSS software.*

Note: Many style guides now encourage active voice even in scientific writing.

### Formal or Diplomatic Contexts

Passive can soften statements or avoid assigning blame:

- *Mistakes **were made**.* (avoids naming who made them)
- *Your application **has been denied**.* (impersonal)
- *It **has been decided** that the project will be postponed.* (authority diffused)

### Instructions and Processes

When the focus is on what happens rather than who does it:

- *The mixture **should be stirred** for five minutes.*
- *Applications **must be submitted** by December 1.*

## 19.5 When to Avoid Passive Voice

### When Active Is Clearer and More Direct

Passive adds words and can obscure meaning:

- **Passive**: *The ball **was kicked** by the child.*
- **Active**: *The child **kicked** the ball.* (clearer, more direct)

- **Passive**: *A decision **was reached** by the committee after deliberation.*
- **Active**: *The committee **reached** a decision after deliberating.* (more engaging)

### When the Agent Is Important

Don't hide relevant information:

- **Passive**: *The evidence **was destroyed**.* (who destroyed it?)
- **Active**: *The defendant **destroyed** the evidence.* (crucial information)

### When Creating Unnecessary Wordiness

Passive typically adds 2-3 words. If you use it without purpose, you add bulk:

- **Wordy passive**: *It **was believed** by the researchers that the hypothesis **was supported** by the data.*
- **Direct active**: *The researchers **believed** the data **supported** the hypothesis.*

### When Creating Dangling Modifiers

Passive can lead to unclear modification:

- *After reviewing the evidence, the defendant **was acquitted**.* (Who reviewed? The defendant? The jury?)
- Better: *After reviewing the evidence, the jury **acquitted** the defendant.*

---

## 19.6 The Get-Passive

Informal English uses **get + past participle** as an alternative to be-passive:

- *He **got fired** last week.*
- *She **got promoted** to senior manager.*
- *They **got married** in June.*
- *The vase **got broken** during the move.*

### Characteristics of Get-Passive

**Subject involvement**: Get-passive often implies the subject has some responsibility or involvement:
- *She **got arrested**.* (suggests her actions led to this)
- *She **was arrested**.* (neutral—just reports the fact)

**Change of state**: Get-passive emphasizes transition:
- *The door **got stuck**.* (became stuck)
- *I **got confused**.* (became confused)

**Informal register**: Get-passive is casual; avoid in formal writing:
- Formal: *The project **was completed** on schedule.*
- Informal: *The project **got done** on time.*

### Get-Passive vs. Be-Passive

| Be-passive | Get-passive |
|------------|-------------|
| Neutral | Implies involvement/result |
| All registers | Informal |
| Stative possible | Typically dynamic |

---

## 19.7 Passive with Two-Object Verbs

Some verbs take two objects (indirect + direct). Both can become passive subjects:

**Active**: *Someone **gave** her an award.*

**Direct object as subject**:
- *An award **was given** to her.*

**Indirect object as subject**:
- *She **was given** an award.*

Both are grammatical. The choice depends on what you want to emphasize.

### More Examples

**Active**: *The company **offered** employees a bonus.*
- *A bonus **was offered** to employees.*
- *Employees **were offered** a bonus.*

**Active**: *They **told** me the news.*
- *The news **was told** to me.*
- *I **was told** the news.*

---

## 19.8 Stative vs. Dynamic Passive

### Dynamic Passive

Describes an action or event:
- *The window **was broken** by vandals.* (an event occurred)
- *The report **is being written** right now.* (ongoing action)

### Stative Passive

Describes a state resulting from an action:
- *The window **is broken**.* (current state)
- *The report **is written** in French.* (characteristic)

The same form can be dynamic or stative depending on context:
- *The door **was closed** at 5 PM.* (event—someone closed it)
- *The door **was closed** when I arrived.* (state—I found it closed)

---

## 19.9 Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Passive voice is always wrong"

**Wrong**: Never use passive voice.

**Right**: Passive is a grammatical tool with legitimate uses. The key is choosing it purposefully, not accidentally. Scientific writing, journalism, and formal contexts often require it.

### Misconception 2: "Passive voice is wordy—always choose active"

**Partial truth**: Passive typically adds words, but sometimes active alternatives are even wordier:

- Passive: *The building was designed by a famous architect.*
- Active: *A famous architect designed the building.*

Both are equally concise. But:
- Passive: *He was given a book.*
- Active: *Someone gave him a book.* (adds "someone")

### Misconception 3: "Any sentence with 'was' is passive"

**Wrong**: *She **was** happy.* = passive?

**Right**: Passive requires *be* + **past participle**. *Was happy* is *be* + adjective (not passive). Similarly:
- *He **was walking**.* = progressive (not passive)
- *She **was** a teacher.* = copular *be* (not passive)

### Misconception 4: "By-phrases are required in passive"

**Wrong**: Every passive needs *by*.

**Right**: Agentless passives (without *by*-phrases) are common and often preferred when the agent is unknown or irrelevant:
- *The suspect **was arrested**.* (no need to say "by police")

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identify Voice

Mark each sentence as active (A) or passive (P).

1. *The proposal was reviewed by the committee.*
2. *Several factors contributed to the delay.*
3. *The results have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.*
4. *The earthquake damaged hundreds of buildings.*
5. *All safety protocols were followed.*
6. *The evidence clearly supports the hypothesis.*
7. *The manuscript is being edited.*
8. *Investigators are examining the wreckage.*

### Exercise 2: Convert to Passive

Convert each sentence to passive voice. Include a by-phrase only if the agent is significant.

1. *A renowned chef prepared the meal.*
2. *Someone has stolen my bicycle.*
3. *The storm destroyed the coastal highway.*
4. *The company will announce the results tomorrow.*
5. *Researchers are conducting a long-term study.*

### Exercise 3: Convert to Active

Convert each sentence to active voice.

1. *The contract was signed by both parties.*
2. *The new policy has been implemented.*
3. *The shipment will be delivered on Tuesday.*
4. *Important discoveries were made during the expedition.*
5. *The patient is being monitored closely.*

### Exercise 4: Choose Appropriate Voice

Decide whether active or passive is more appropriate. Rewrite if needed.

1. *A mistake was made by me.* (Context: personal apology)
2. *The suspect stole the painting.* (Context: newspaper headline)
3. *The samples were analyzed.* (Context: scientific report)
4. *The fire destroyed the warehouse.* (Context: news report focusing on destruction)
5. *The award was won by our team.* (Context: celebrating achievement)

### Exercise 5: Identify Errors and Awkwardness

Some sentences use passive voice awkwardly. Identify issues and revise.

1. *After being reviewed by the committee, we approved the proposal.*
2. *The ball was hit by John over the fence.*
3. *It was decided by management that layoffs would be implemented.*
4. *The movie was watched by millions of viewers.*
5. *Smoking is not permitted to be done in this area.*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Voice Analysis

Find a paragraph from a newspaper article and one from a scientific paper. Compare:
- How many passive constructions appear in each?
- What purposes does passive serve in each context?
- Are any passives problematic or unnecessary?

### Activity 2: Revision for Clarity

Revise this paragraph to improve clarity by changing passive to active where appropriate:

*The experiment was conducted by researchers at the university. First, the subjects were divided into two groups. Then a questionnaire was administered. After the data were collected, they were analyzed by the team. It was found that significant differences existed. The results were published in a major journal.*

### Activity 3: Strategic Passive Use

Write a short paragraph (5-6 sentences) describing a process (cooking a dish, performing an experiment, manufacturing a product) using passive voice appropriately to focus on the process rather than the doer.

## Chapter Summary

- **Voice** describes the relationship between subject and action: in **active voice**, the subject acts; in **passive voice**, the subject is acted upon.
- **Passive is formed** with appropriate *be* + past participle.
- **Use passive** when the agent is unknown/unimportant, to emphasize the receiver, maintain topic continuity, or in formal/scientific contexts.
- **Avoid passive** when active is clearer, when the agent matters, or when it creates wordiness or unclear modification.
- **Get-passive** (*got fired*) is informal and implies subject involvement or change of state.
- Passive is a tool, not an error—use it purposefully.
