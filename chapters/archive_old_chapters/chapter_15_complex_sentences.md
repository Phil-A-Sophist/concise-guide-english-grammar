## 15.1 What Is a Complex Sentence?

A **complex sentence** contains one independent clause and at least one **dependent (subordinate) clause**. Unlike compound sentences, which present ideas as equals, complex sentences create a hierarchy—one idea is primary, another is supporting.

### Independent vs. Dependent Clauses

An **independent clause** has a subject and predicate and expresses a complete thought:
- *The power flickered.*
- *Everyone looked up.*

A **dependent clause** has a subject and predicate but cannot stand alone—it "depends" on another clause to complete its meaning:
- ***when** the power flickered* (What happened then?)
- ***that** everyone noticed* (What about it?)

The subordinating word (*when*, *that*, *because*, *who*, etc.) transforms what could be an independent clause into a dependent one.

### Complex Sentences

Combining independent and dependent clauses creates a complex sentence:
- *Everyone looked up **when the power flickered**.*
- *The fact **that everyone noticed** surprised the speaker.*

The dependent clause provides supporting information—context, explanation, specification—for the main clause.

### Why Use Complex Sentences?

**To show relationships**: Complex sentences make causal, temporal, and conditional relationships explicit. *Everyone panicked when the alarm sounded* is clearer than *The alarm sounded. Everyone panicked.*

**To emphasize main ideas**: By subordinating less important information, you guide readers toward what matters most.

**To create sophisticated prose**: Varied sentence structures make writing more engaging and professional.

## 15.2 Visualizing Complex Sentences

Tree diagrams reveal how dependent clauses embed within the main sentence structure.

### Complex Sentence Structure

![Tree diagram showing complex sentence with subordinate clause](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-14-complex-sub.png)

*Figure 14.1: A complex sentence with an adverb clause. The subordinate clause (introduced by "when") attaches to the main clause, showing when the main action occurred.*

Notice that the subordinate clause is itself an S (sentence) with its own subject and verb, but it's embedded within the larger sentence structure rather than standing independently.

### Relative Clause Structure

Relative clauses embed within noun phrases, modifying a specific noun.

![Tree diagram showing relative clause](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-22-relative.png)

*Figure 14.2: A relative clause modifying a noun. The clause "who fell" is embedded within the NP "the man who fell."*

The relative clause attaches inside the NP it modifies, creating a more complex noun phrase.

## 15.3 Types of Dependent Clauses

Dependent clauses are classified by their grammatical function.

### Adverb Clauses (Adverbial Clauses)

**Adverb clauses** modify verbs, adjectives, or entire sentences. They answer questions like *when?*, *why?*, *under what conditions?*, *with what result?*

**Time**: *When did it happen?*
- *We celebrated **when the results came in**.*
- ***After the concert ended**, the crowd dispersed slowly.*

**Reason**: *Why?*
- *She declined the invitation **because she had other commitments**.*
- ***Since you asked**, I'll explain my reasoning.*

**Contrast**: *Despite what?*
- ***Although the evidence was strong**, the jury remained skeptical.*
- *The project succeeded **even though we faced numerous obstacles**.*

**Condition**: *Under what circumstances?*
- ***If the weather improves**, we'll go hiking.*
- *I won't sign **unless you modify the contract**.*

### Relative Clauses (Adjective Clauses)

**Relative clauses** modify nouns, specifying which person, thing, or place is meant. They're introduced by relative pronouns (*who*, *whom*, *which*, *that*, *whose*) or relative adverbs (*where*, *when*, *why*).

- *The candidate **who impressed the committee** received the position.*
- *The novel **that won the award** explores identity and belonging.*
- *This is the park **where we first met**.*

### Noun Clauses

**Noun clauses** function as noun phrases—they can be subjects, objects, or complements. They're introduced by *that*, *whether*, *if*, or wh-words (*what*, *who*, *how*, *why*, etc.).

**As subject**:
- ***That she resigned** shocked the board.*
- ***What happens next** remains uncertain.*

**As direct object**:
- *I understand **that you're frustrated**.*
- *She couldn't explain **why the system failed**.*

**As subject complement**:
- *The problem is **that we underestimated demand**.*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the dependent clause and its type:

*The restaurant where we celebrated has closed.*

*(Answer: "where we celebrated" — relative clause modifying "restaurant")*

## 15.4 Subordinating Conjunctions

**Subordinating conjunctions** introduce adverb clauses and specify the relationship between the dependent and independent clauses.

### Common Subordinating Conjunctions by Relationship

| Relationship | Subordinating Conjunctions |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Time** | *when, while, before, after, until, since, as, once, whenever, as soon as* |
| **Cause/Reason** | *because, since, as, given that, now that* |
| **Contrast** | *although, though, even though, while, whereas, even if* |
| **Condition** | *if, unless, provided that, in case, assuming that, as long as* |
| **Purpose** | *so that, in order that, lest* |
| **Result** | *so...that, such...that* |
| **Manner/Comparison** | *as, as if, as though, than* |

### Examples by Relationship

**Time relationships**:
- ***Once** the decision was made, we moved quickly.*
- *The committee deliberated **until** they reached consensus.*
- ***Whenever** I visit that city, I discover something new.*

**Causal relationships**:
- ***Because** funding was cut, the program ended.*
- ***Now that** you mention it, I do remember.*

**Contrastive relationships**:
- ***Even though** the odds were against us, we persisted.*
- *The team performed well **whereas** expectations were low.*

**Conditional relationships**:
- ***Unless** circumstances change, we'll proceed as planned.*
- ***Provided that** all parties agree, we can finalize the contract.*

**Purpose relationships**:
- *She documented everything **so that** there would be no confusion later.*

### Check Your Understanding

Choose the best subordinating conjunction:

*_____ the meeting started, several participants were still arriving.*

A. Although
B. When
C. Because

*(Answer: B—"When" indicates timing)*

## 15.5 Relative Clauses in Detail

### Relative Pronouns

| Pronoun | Use | Example |
|---------|-----|---------|
| *who* | subject (people) | *the architect **who** designed the building* |
| *whom* | object (people) | *the architect **whom** we hired* |
| *which* | subject/object (things) | *the proposal **which** was rejected* |
| *that* | subject/object (people or things) | *the candidate **that** impressed us* |
| *whose* | possession | *the author **whose** book we discussed* |

### Relative Adverbs

| Adverb | Reference | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| *where* | place | *the office **where** I work* |
| *when* | time | *the era **when** radio dominated* |
| *why* | reason | *the reason **why** she resigned* |

### Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive Clauses

This distinction is crucial for both meaning and punctuation.

**Restrictive clauses** (essential) identify which specific person or thing is meant:
- *Employees **who complete the training** will receive certification.*
- Meaning: Only those employees who complete the training
- No commas

**Non-restrictive clauses** (non-essential) add supplementary information:
- *The employees**, who completed the training,** received certification.*
- Meaning: All the employees (and by the way, they completed the training)
- Set off with commas

**The removal test**: If removing the clause significantly changes which person/thing you mean, it's restrictive.

### Omitting the Relative Pronoun

When the relative pronoun functions as the **object** of its clause, you can often omit it:

- *The book **(that/which)** I recommended is out of print.* ✓
- *The colleague **(whom/that)** you met has transferred.* ✓

When the relative pronoun is the **subject**, you cannot omit it:

- *The book **that** changed my perspective...* (cannot omit)
- *The colleague **who** transferred...* (cannot omit)

### Check Your Understanding

Add commas if needed:

*My brother who lives in Seattle is visiting next week.*

*(Answer: If you have only one brother, add commas: "My brother, who lives in Seattle, is visiting." If you have multiple brothers and you're specifying which one, no commas.)*

## 15.6 Noun Clauses in Detail

### Words That Introduce Noun Clauses

**That** (declarative content):
- *I believe **(that)** we can succeed.*
- *The fact **(that)** she agreed surprised everyone.*

Note: *That* is often omissible when the clause is a direct object, but required when it's a subject.

**Whether/If** (yes-no questions as content):
- *I don't know **whether** they'll accept.*
- *She asked **if** we could postpone.*

**Wh-words** (information questions as content):
- *I wonder **what** happened.*
- *She explained **how** the system works.*
- *Nobody knows **why** he resigned.*

### Functions of Noun Clauses

**Subject**:
- ***That the experiment failed** disappointed the team.*
- ***What we discovered** exceeded expectations.*

**Direct object**:
- *The committee discussed **whether to proceed**.*
- *I can't imagine **how she managed**.*

**Subject complement**:
- *The challenge is **that resources are limited**.*
- *My concern is **whether we have enough time**.*

**Object of preposition**:
- *We argued about **what the data showed**.*
- *The decision depends on **whether funding continues**.*

## 15.7 Punctuation of Complex Sentences

### Adverb Clauses

**Introductory adverb clause → comma**:
- ***Before the presentation began**, she reviewed her notes.*
- ***Although the task was difficult**, the team persevered.*

**Final adverb clause → usually no comma**:
- *She reviewed her notes **before the presentation began**.*
- *The team persevered **although the task was difficult**.*

**Exception**: Use a comma before a final clause that expresses strong contrast:
- *She accepted the offer**, even though she had reservations**.*

### Relative Clauses

**Restrictive → no commas**:
- *The proposal **that addressed sustainability** was selected.*

**Non-restrictive → commas**:
- *The proposal**, which addressed sustainability,** was selected by unanimous vote.*

### Noun Clauses

Generally no special punctuation:
- ***That the negotiations failed** was disappointing.*
- *I understand **why you're concerned**.*

---

## 15.8 Coordination vs. Subordination

Understanding when to coordinate and when to subordinate helps you control emphasis and meaning.

### Coordination (Compound Sentences)

Presents ideas as equally important:
- *The proposal was innovative, **and** it addressed key concerns.*
- *She had doubts, **but** she supported the decision.*

### Subordination (Complex Sentences)

Makes one idea primary, another supporting:
- ***Although** the proposal was innovative, it faced opposition.* (innovation subordinated)
- ***Because** she had doubts, she requested more data.* (doubts subordinated)

### Choosing Between Them

**Use coordination when**:
- Both ideas deserve equal emphasis
- You want balanced, parallel structure
- The relationship is simple addition or contrast

**Use subordination when**:
- One idea is background/context for another
- You want to emphasize cause-effect or condition relationships
- You want to de-emphasize secondary information

**Compare these versions**:
- *The deadline passed, and we submitted anyway.* (equal emphasis)
- *The deadline passed, but we submitted anyway.* (contrast, equal emphasis)
- ***Although** the deadline passed, we submitted anyway.* (deadline subordinated, submission emphasized)
- *We submitted **even though** the deadline had passed.* (same meaning, submission even more prominent)

## 15.9 Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "Subordinate clauses are less important"

**Partial truth**: Subordinate clauses receive less grammatical emphasis, but they often carry crucial information. In *Because the bridge collapsed, traffic was rerouted*, the cause (bridge collapse) is subordinated but essential to understanding.

### Misconception 2: "That can always be omitted"

**Wrong**: *That she resigned surprised us.* → *She resigned surprised us.* ✗

**Right**: *That* can be omitted when introducing a noun clause functioning as direct object (*I know she's leaving*), but not when the clause is the subject.

### Misconception 3: "Which and that are interchangeable"

**Nuanced**: In American English, *that* typically introduces restrictive clauses and *which* introduces non-restrictive clauses:
- *The car **that** I bought runs well.* (restrictive—which car)
- *The car**, which** I bought last year**,** runs well.* (non-restrictive—additional info)

British English uses *which* for both, but the comma distinction still matters.

### Misconception 4: "Never start a sentence with because"

**Wrong**: This "rule" is a myth. Starting with *because* is grammatically correct:
- ***Because** the roads were icy, we drove slowly.* ✓

The problem to avoid is a fragment: *Because the roads were icy.* (incomplete)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identifying Clause Types

Identify each dependent clause as adverb (Adv), relative (Rel), or noun (N).

1. *The company expanded **after the merger was finalized**.*
2. *The consultant **whom we hired** identified several inefficiencies.*
3. *I doubt **that the timeline is realistic**.*
4. ***What the audit revealed** prompted an investigation.*
5. *The town **where the conference is held** attracts many visitors.*
6. ***Even though reviews were mixed**, the film performed well at the box office.*

### Exercise 2: Subordinating Conjunctions

Choose the most appropriate subordinating conjunction.

1. *_____ the evidence was circumstantial, the jury convicted.* (contrast)
2. *We postponed the launch _____ testing was incomplete.* (reason)
3. *_____ you finish the report, send me a copy.* (time)
4. *I'll approve the budget _____ you reduce travel expenses.* (condition)
5. *She documented her process _____ others could replicate her results.* (purpose)

### Exercise 3: Relative Clauses

Complete with the appropriate relative pronoun or adverb.

1. *The researcher _____ work revolutionized the field received the prize.*
2. *This is the laboratory _____ the discovery was made.*
3. *The theory _____ he proposed has been widely tested.*
4. *Students _____ submit late will lose points.*
5. *The reason _____ she declined remains unclear.*

### Exercise 4: Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive

Add commas where needed. If no commas are needed, write "correct."

1. *My supervisor who has twenty years of experience approved the plan.*
2. *Employees who complete training receive certification.*
3. *The original proposal which was submitted in March has been revised.*
4. *The candidate that impressed us most was hired.*
5. *Her brother who lives abroad rarely visits.*

### Exercise 5: Sentence Combining

Combine each pair using subordination. Use the relationship indicated.

1. *The system crashed. We lost several hours of work.* (result)
2. *She lacks formal credentials. She has extensive practical experience.* (contrast)
3. *Someone told me something. The project has been canceled.* (noun clause)
4. *I met a researcher. This researcher developed the algorithm.* (relative clause)
5. *The weather improves. We will resume outdoor activities.* (condition)

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Subordination Analysis

Find a paragraph from an academic article or quality journalism. For each complex sentence:
- Identify independent and dependent clauses
- Classify dependent clauses by type
- Explain why the writer chose to subordinate that particular information

### Activity 2: Rewriting for Emphasis

Take this passage and rewrite it twice: once emphasizing the weather, once emphasizing the decision.

*The conference was scheduled for Saturday. The forecast predicted severe storms. The organizers decided to postpone.*

**Version emphasizing weather**: *(Hint: subordinate the decision)*

**Version emphasizing decision**: *(Hint: subordinate the weather)*

### Activity 3: Punctuating Relative Clauses

Write two sentences for each noun below—one with a restrictive relative clause, one with a non-restrictive clause. Explain how the meaning changes.

1. The employees...
2. The proposal...
3. My colleague...

---

## Chapter Summary

- **Complex sentences** contain one independent clause and at least one dependent clause, creating hierarchical emphasis.
- **Dependent clauses** are classified by function: **adverb** (modify verbs/sentences), **relative** (modify nouns), or **noun** (function as NPs).
- **Subordinating conjunctions** introduce adverb clauses, specifying time, cause, contrast, condition, or purpose relationships.
- **Relative pronouns** (*who*, *whom*, *which*, *that*, *whose*) and **relative adverbs** (*where*, *when*, *why*) introduce relative clauses.
- **Restrictive** relative clauses (no commas) identify which; **non-restrictive** (commas) add extra information.
- **Noun clauses** are introduced by *that*, *whether*, *if*, or wh-words and function as subjects, objects, or complements.
- **Punctuation**: Introductory adverb clauses take commas; non-restrictive relative clauses are set off with commas.
- **Subordination** de-emphasizes supporting information to highlight main ideas.
