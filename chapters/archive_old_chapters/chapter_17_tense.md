## 17.1 What Is Tense?

**Tense** is a grammatical category that locates situations in time relative to some reference point, typically the moment of speaking. In English, tense is marked by inflecting the verb.

### Tense vs. Time

**Tense** is grammatical—a form of the verb.
**Time** is conceptual—when something happens.

English has only **two morphological tenses**: present and past. We express future time through other means (modals, aspect), not a distinct verb form.

| Tense | Marked by | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Present | base form or -s | *walk, walks* |
| Past | -ed or irregular form | *walked, went* |
| Future | modal *will* (no inflection) | *will walk* |

---

## 17.2 Present Tense

### Formation

**Regular verbs:**
- Base form: *I/you/we/they walk*
- Third person -s: *she/he/it walks*

**Spelling rules for -s:**
- Most verbs: add -s (*walks, runs*)
- Verbs ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, -z: add -es (*watches, fixes*)
- Verbs ending in consonant + y: change y to -ies (*studies, carries*)
- Irregular: *has, does, goes*

### Uses of Present Tense

**Habitual actions:**
- *She **walks** to school every day.*
- *I **drink** coffee in the morning.*

**General truths:**
- *Water **boils** at 100°C.*
- *The sun **rises** in the east.*

**States:**
- *She **knows** the answer.*
- *I **love** this city.*

**Scheduled future events:**
- *The train **leaves** at noon.*
- *The semester **starts** next week.*

**Performatives:**
- *I **apologize** for the delay.*
- *I **promise** to help.*

**Historical present (narrative):**
- *So then he **walks** up and **says**...*

---

## 17.3 Past Tense

### Formation

**Regular verbs:** Add -ed
- *walk → walked*
- *play → played*
- *study → studied*

**Spelling rules for -ed:**
- Most verbs: add -ed (*walked, played*)
- Verbs ending in -e: add -d (*hoped, loved*)
- Verbs ending in consonant + y: change y to -ied (*studied, carried*)
- Verbs ending in CVC: double final consonant (*stopped, planned*)

**Irregular verbs:** Various patterns
- Vowel change: *sing → sang*, *run → ran*
- Different form: *go → went*, *be → was/were*
- No change: *put → put*, *cut → cut*

### Uses of Past Tense

**Completed past events:**
- *She **walked** to school yesterday.*
- *I **finished** the book last week.*

**Past states:**
- *He **lived** in Boston for ten years.*
- *She **knew** the answer.*

**Hypotheticals (irrealis):**
- *If I **had** more time, I would help.* (but I don't)
- *I wish I **were** taller.* (but I'm not)

**Polite requests:**
- *I **wanted** to ask you something.*
- ***Could** you help me?* (past form for politeness)

---

## 17.4 Future Time

English has no future tense inflection. We express future time through:

### Will/Shall + Base Form

- *She **will arrive** tomorrow.*
- *I **shall return**.* (formal)

### Be Going To + Base Form

- *It**'s going to rain**.*
- *They **are going to move**.*

### Present Progressive

- *She **is arriving** tomorrow.*
- *We **are meeting** at noon.*

### Simple Present

- *The train **leaves** at noon.*
- *The semester **starts** next week.*

### Differences

**Will** - prediction, decision, willingness:
- *I think it **will** rain.*
- *I**'ll** help you.* (instant decision)

**Be going to** - intention, imminent event:
- *I**'m going to** study medicine.* (planned)
- *Look at those clouds! It**'s going to** rain.* (imminent)

## 17.5 Tense in Complex Verb Phrases

### Tense Is Marked on the First Verb

In complex verb phrases, tense appears on the first element:

- ***Is** reading* (present: *is*)
- ***Was** reading* (past: *was*)
- ***Has** finished* (present: *has*)
- ***Had** finished* (past: *had*)
- ***Will** arrive* (present: *will*)

### Tense and Modals

Modals have present and past forms, but the distinction often doesn't indicate time:

| Present | Past |
|---------|------|
| can | could |
| will | would |
| shall | should |
| may | might |
| (must) | - |

**True past meaning:**
- *I **could** swim when I was five.* (past ability)

**No time difference:**
- ***Could** you help me?* (polite—not past time)
- *It **might** rain.* (possibility—not past time)

---

## 17.6 Sequence of Tenses

In complex sentences, tense in subordinate clauses often adjusts to match the main clause.

### Backshifting

When the main clause is past, subordinate clauses typically shift back:

**Direct:** *She says, "I **am** tired."*
**Indirect:** *She said that she **was** tired.*

**Direct:** *He says, "I **will** come."*
**Indirect:** *He said that he **would** come.*

### Exceptions

**Timeless truths:**
- *He said that water **boils** at 100°C.* (present OK)

**Still true:**
- *She said she **is** tired.* (if still true now)

---

## 17.7 Tense and Meaning

### Present Tense for Non-Present

Present tense doesn't always mean present time:

**Future:** *The train **leaves** at noon.*
**Past (narrative):** *So he **walks** up to me and **says**...*
**Timeless:** *Two plus two **equals** four.*

### Past Tense for Non-Past

Past tense doesn't always mean past time:

**Hypothetical:** *If I **knew** the answer, I'd tell you.* (I don't know)
**Polite:** *I **wanted** to ask you something.* (present request)
**Past modal:** ***Could** you help?* (present request)

This shows that tense is a grammatical category, not just a marker of time.

## Form and Function Tests

### Identifying Tense

Look at the **first verb** in the VP:
- Base form or -s = present
- -ed or past form = past
- Modal = present (usually)

### Distinguishing Tense and Time

Ask: What form is the verb? (tense)
Ask: When does the action occur? (time)

*The train **leaves** at noon.*
- Tense: present (*leaves*)
- Time: future (noon tomorrow)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 3: Tense vs. Time

For each sentence, identify the tense and the time reference.

1. *The train leaves at noon tomorrow.*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Tense Analysis

Find a short text and analyze every verb for tense. Note any cases where tense and time don't align.

### Activity 2: Future Expression Choice

Write three sentences about your plans for next week using different future expressions. Explain your choice.

### Activity 3: Hypotheticals

Write five sentences using past tense for hypothetical (unreal) situations. Note that the time reference is present or future, not past.

## Chapter Summary

- **Tense** is a grammatical category marked by verb inflection; **time** is conceptual.
- English has two morphological tenses: **present** and **past**.
- **Future time** is expressed through modals, *be going to*, and present forms—not a separate tense.
- Tense is marked on the **first verb** in the verb phrase.
- Present tense can refer to future time; past tense can refer to hypothetical situations.
- **Sequence of tenses** adjusts subordinate clauses to main clause tense.
