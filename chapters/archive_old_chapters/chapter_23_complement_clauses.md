## 23.1 What Are Complement Clauses?

A **complement clause** (also called a **noun clause**) is a dependent clause that functions like a noun phrase. It can serve as a subject, direct object, subject complement, or complement to certain adjectives and nouns.

### Comparing Noun Phrases and Complement Clauses

| Function | Noun Phrase | Complement Clause |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Subject | *The news* shocked us. | ***That she resigned*** shocked us. |
| Direct Object | I know *the answer*. | I know ***that she resigned***. |
| Subject Complement | The problem is *the cost*. | The problem is ***that we're late***. |

### Three Types of Complement Clauses

1. **That-clauses**: *I believe **that the economy will improve**.*
2. **Wh-clauses**: *I wonder **where she went**.*
3. **Infinitive complements**: *She wants **to leave early**.*

Each type has distinct properties and is selected by different verbs, adjectives, and nouns.

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the complement clause and its function: *What the investigation revealed surprised everyone.*

*(Answer: Complement clause: "What the investigation revealed"; Function: subject)*

---

## 23.2 That-Clauses

**That-clauses** are introduced by the complementizer *that* and contain a complete statement with subject and finite verb.

### As Direct Object

The most common function. *That* can often be omitted:

- *The scientist believes **(that) the hypothesis is correct**.*
- *Everyone knows **(that) practice improves performance**.*
- *The report confirms **(that) the project succeeded**.*
- *She mentioned **(that) the meeting was postponed**.*

### As Subject

Less common; *that* is required:

- ***That the team won** surprised no one.*
- ***That prices have increased** concerns consumers.*
- ***That he apologized** means a great deal.*

Subject *that*-clauses often sound formal or heavy. See extraposition (Section 23.6) for an alternative.

### As Subject Complement

Following the verb *be* (or similar linking verbs):

- *The problem is **that we lack sufficient funding**.*
- *The truth is **that nobody foresaw this outcome**.*
- *The concern remains **that supplies will run short**.*

### As Adjective Complement

Following certain adjectives that describe emotions, certainty, or attitudes:

- *I'm pleased **that you could attend**.*
- *She's confident **that the project will succeed**.*
- *We're concerned **that deadlines might slip**.*
- *He's afraid **that he'll miss the flight**.*

Common adjectives taking *that*-complements: *afraid, aware, certain, confident, glad, happy, pleased, sorry, sure, surprised, worried*

### As Noun Complement (Appositive)

Following abstract nouns, expanding on their meaning:

- *The **fact** that she declined surprised us.*
- *The **idea** that time is relative revolutionized physics.*
- *His **claim** that he was elsewhere lacks evidence.*
- *The **news** that the merger failed spread quickly.*

Common nouns taking *that*-complements: *fact, idea, claim, news, report, belief, hope, suggestion, possibility, assumption*

### Check Your Understanding

What is the function of the *that*-clause in this sentence? *Her claim that the data was falsified requires investigation.*

*(Answer: Noun complement—the clause explains what the claim is)*

---

## 23.3 Verbs That Take That-Clauses

Different verbs select *that*-clause complements for different semantic reasons.

### Verbs of Cognition (Mental States)

These verbs describe what someone thinks, believes, or knows:

- *think, believe, know, realize, understand, recognize, assume, suppose, imagine, suspect, doubt, feel, guess*

Examples:
- *I **think** that the solution is straightforward.*
- *She **realizes** that mistakes were made.*
- *We **assume** that the schedule remains unchanged.*

### Verbs of Communication

These verbs describe what someone says or communicates:

- *say, tell, mention, report, explain, announce, admit, claim, deny, state, argue, suggest, insist*

Examples:
- *The spokesperson **announced** that changes would occur.*
- *He **admitted** that he had made an error.*
- *They **denied** that any misconduct occurred.*

### Verbs of Emotion and Attitude

These verbs describe emotional responses:

- *hope, wish, fear, regret, prefer, mind, resent*

Examples:
- *I **hope** that you'll reconsider.*
- *She **regrets** that she didn't accept the offer.*
- *They **prefer** that meetings remain virtual.*

### Verbs of Perception

These verbs describe what someone notices or observes:

- *see, hear, notice, observe, find, discover*

Examples:
- *We **noticed** that the noise had stopped.*
- *They **discovered** that the files were missing.*

### Factive vs. Non-Factive Verbs

**Factive verbs** presuppose that the complement clause is true:
- *regret, realize, know, discover, notice*
- *I **regret** that I missed the event.* (I did miss it)

**Non-factive verbs** don't presuppose truth:
- *think, believe, assume, claim, hope*
- *I **believe** that she resigned.* (She may or may not have)

This distinction matters for nuanced meaning.

### Check Your Understanding

Is *know* factive or non-factive? How can you tell?

*(Answer: Factive. "I know that she left" presupposes she actually left.)*

---

## 23.4 Wh-Clauses (Indirect Questions)

**Wh-clauses** are introduced by wh-words (*what, who, where, when, why, how, whether, if*) and represent indirect questions or uncertain information.

### Formation

Unlike direct questions, wh-clauses use **declarative word order** (subject before verb):

| Direct Question | Indirect Question (Wh-clause) |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| *Where does she live?* | *I wonder **where she lives**.* |
| *What did he say?* | *Tell me **what he said**.* |
| *Who won the award?* | *I know **who won the award**.* |

### As Direct Object

- *I wonder **what they decided**.*
- *She asked **where the meeting was held**.*
- *Nobody knows **when they will arrive**.*
- *Can you explain **how this works**?*
- *I'm not sure **whether the store is open**.*

### As Subject

- ***What she said** angered the committee.*
- ***Where they went** remains a mystery.*
- ***How the accident happened** is under investigation.*
- ***Whether they'll accept** is uncertain.*

### As Subject Complement

- *The question is **what we should do next**.*
- *The issue is **whether funding will continue**.*
- *The mystery is **how they escaped**.*

### As Prepositional Object

- *I'm curious about **what she discovered**.*
- *The debate centers on **whether to expand**.*
- *We disagree about **how to proceed**.*

### The Wh-Word's Function Within the Clause

The wh-word plays a grammatical role inside the complement clause:

- ***What** she said* (*what* = object of *said*)
- ***Who** called* (*who* = subject of *called*)
- ***Where** he lives* (*where* = adverbial modifier)
- ***How** she solved it* (*how* = adverbial modifier)
- ***Why** they left* (*why* = reason adverbial)

### Whether vs. If

Both introduce yes/no indirect questions, but they're not always interchangeable:

**Both acceptable after most verbs**:
- *I wonder **whether/if** she's coming.*
- *Do you know **whether/if** the office is open?*

**Only *whether*** in these contexts:
- Before infinitives: *I don't know **whether** to accept.* (not *~~if~~*)
- After prepositions: *The debate about **whether** to expand...* (not *~~if~~*)
- As subject: ***Whether** she'll attend is uncertain.* (awkward with *if*)
- With *or not* immediately following: *I wonder **whether or not** she's ready.* (not *~~if or not~~*)

### Check Your Understanding

Why is this ungrammatical? *I don't know if to accept the offer.*

*(Answer: Infinitive complements require "whether," not "if." Correct: "I don't know whether to accept.")*

---

## 23.5 Infinitive Complements

**Infinitive complements** use *to* + base verb and represent actions, states, or events connected to the main clause.

### Direct Object (Subject of Infinitive = Main Subject)

Some verbs take a simple infinitive with the same implied subject:

- *She **wants to leave** early.* (She leaves)
- *They **decided to expand** operations.* (They expand)
- *He **hopes to finish** by Friday.* (He finishes)
- *We **plan to announce** the results tomorrow.* (We announce)

Common verbs: *want, need, hope, wish, expect, decide, plan, intend, promise, agree, refuse, learn, seem, appear, tend, pretend, offer, fail*

### Object + Infinitive (Different Subject)

Some verbs take an object NP, which serves as the subject of the infinitive:

- *She **wants him to leave**.* (He leaves)
- *They **expect us to participate**.* (We participate)
- *The manager **asked her to stay**.* (She stays)
- *I **encouraged them to apply**.* (They apply)

Common verbs: *want, need, expect, ask, tell, advise, encourage, allow, permit, forbid, force, order, persuade, remind, invite, teach, help*

### Raising Verbs

Some verbs appear to take an object + infinitive but actually involve **subject raising**—the object is semantically the subject of the embedded clause:

- *I **believe her to be** qualified.* ≈ *I believe **that she is qualified**.*
- *We **consider him to be** an expert.* ≈ *We consider **that he is an expert**.*
- *They **found the task to be** challenging.* ≈ *They found **that the task was challenging**.*

Common raising verbs: *believe, consider, find, prove, assume, expect*

### After Adjectives

Infinitives follow many adjectives, especially those describing emotions, willingness, or evaluation:

- *I'm **happy to help**.*
- *She's **eager to learn**.*
- *They're **reluctant to commit**.*
- *We're **ready to begin**.*
- *The proposal is **easy to understand**.*

### After Nouns

Some nouns take infinitive complements:

- *Her **decision to resign** surprised everyone.*
- *Their **ability to adapt** impressed us.*
- *He expressed his **intention to apply**.*
- *The **plan to expand** requires funding.*

### For-To Infinitives

When the infinitive has a different subject, *for* + NP introduces it:

- ***For her to succeed** would require dedication.* (Subject infinitive)
- *I arranged **for them to attend**.*
- *It's important **for everyone to participate**.*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the subject of the infinitive: *The committee persuaded her to reconsider.*

*(Answer: "her"—she is the one who will reconsider)*

---

## 23.6 That-Clause vs. Infinitive: Choosing Between Them

Some verbs can take both *that*-clauses and infinitive complements, sometimes with meaning differences.

### Same Meaning, Different Structure

- *I expect **that she will succeed**.* = *I expect **her to succeed**.*
- *They believe **that he is honest**.* = *They believe **him to be honest**.*

### Different Meanings

With some verbs, the choice affects meaning:

**Remember/Forget**:
- *I remembered **that I locked the door**.* (I recalled the fact)
- *I remembered **to lock the door**.* (I didn't forget to do it)

**Stop**:
- *He stopped **smoking**.* (quit the habit)
- *He stopped **to smoke**.* (paused in order to smoke)

**Try**:
- *I tried **to open the door**.* (attempted but may have failed)
- *I tried **opening the door**.* (tested this as a solution)

### Verb-Specific Requirements

Some verbs require one type:

**Only that-clause**: *believe, doubt, deny, mention*
- *I **doubt** that she'll come.* (not *~~I doubt her to come~~*)

**Only infinitive**: *decide, manage, refuse, afford*
- *She **decided** to leave.* (not *~~She decided that to leave~~*)

### Check Your Understanding

What's the meaning difference?
- *He forgot that he had met her.*
- *He forgot to meet her.*

*(Answer: First = He had met her but later couldn't recall it. Second = He failed to meet her as planned.)*

---

## 23.7 Extraposition

**Extraposition** moves a heavy subject clause to the end of the sentence, leaving *it* as a placeholder in subject position.

### Why Extrapose?

Subject clauses can make sentences feel top-heavy:
- ***That she would decline the offer** surprised everyone.* (long subject)

Extraposition creates better balance:
- ***It** surprised everyone **that she would decline the offer**.*

### With That-Clauses

- ***It** is obvious **that we need more time**.*
- ***It** seems **that the project was delayed**.*
- ***It** happened **that I was there**.*
- ***It** turned out **that she was right**.*

### With Wh-Clauses

- ***It** doesn't matter **what they think**.*
- ***It** remains unclear **why the system failed**.*
- ***It** is uncertain **whether they'll participate**.*

### With Infinitive Clauses

- ***It** is important **to verify the data**.*
- ***It** would be unwise **to ignore the warning**.*
- ***It** is difficult **for newcomers to adapt**.*

### Anticipatory It vs. Empty It

**Anticipatory *it*** (extraposition)—the *it* refers to the extraposed clause:
- ***It** is crucial **that we act now**.* (*it* = *that we act now*)

**Empty *it*** (weather, time, distance)—nothing is extraposed:
- ***It** is raining.* (*it* refers to nothing)
- ***It** is Tuesday.*

### Check Your Understanding

Rewrite with extraposition: *That the evidence was fabricated shocked the jury.*

*(Answer: "It shocked the jury that the evidence was fabricated.")*

---

## 23.8 Subjunctive in Complement Clauses

Some complement clauses use the **mandative subjunctive**—the base form of the verb regardless of subject.

### After Verbs of Demand, Suggestion, Requirement

- *The committee **demanded** that he **resign**.* (not *resigns*)
- *I **suggest** that she **reconsider**.* (not *reconsiders*)
- *They **insisted** that the policy **be** changed.* (not *is*)
- *The rules **require** that everyone **submit** documentation.* (not *submits*)

Common verbs: *demand, suggest, insist, recommend, propose, request, require, ask, urge, advise*

### After Adjectives

- *It's essential that he **be** present.*
- *It's important that everyone **remain** calm.*
- *It's vital that the team **meet** the deadline.*

Common adjectives: *essential, important, vital, necessary, crucial, imperative, advisable*

### British English Alternative

British English often uses *should* + infinitive instead:
- American: *They suggested that she **attend**.*
- British: *They suggested that she **should attend**.*

### Check Your Understanding

Complete with the correct form: *The doctor recommended that he _____ (take) the medication daily.*

*(Answer: "take"—subjunctive base form)*

---

## 23.9 Common Errors and Misconceptions

### Error 1: Incorrect Word Order in Wh-Clauses

**Incorrect**: *I wonder **where does she live**.*
**Correct**: *I wonder **where she lives**.*

Wh-clauses use declarative order, not question order.

### Error 2: Using If Before Infinitives

**Incorrect**: *I don't know **if to accept**.*
**Correct**: *I don't know **whether to accept**.*

Only *whether* can precede infinitives.

### Error 3: Omitting That When Needed

**Potentially confusing**: *The report said the CEO resigned surprised everyone.*
**Clear**: *The report said **that** the CEO resigned surprised everyone.* (Still confusing!)
**Better**: *The report **that** said the CEO resigned surprised everyone.*
or *The report said **that** the CEO had resigned, which surprised everyone.*

Keep *that* when omitting it causes ambiguity.

### Error 4: Wrong Complementizer

**Incorrect**: *I know **what** she is honest.* (should be *that*)
**Correct**: *I know **that** she is honest.*

**Incorrect**: *I wonder **that** she went.* (should be *where*)
**Correct**: *I wonder **where** she went.*

Match the complementizer to the meaning.

### Error 5: Indicative Instead of Subjunctive

**Non-standard**: *They demanded that he **resigns**.*
**Standard**: *They demanded that he **resign**.*

After certain verbs/adjectives, use the base form.

### Misconception: "That Can Always Be Omitted"

**Myth**: *That* is always optional.

**Reality**: *That* is required:
- In subject position: ***That** she agreed surprised us.*
- After certain verbs: *He replied **that** he disagreed.* (*replied* requires *that*)
- When omission causes confusion

### Check Your Understanding

What's wrong? *She asked where did I put the keys.*

*(Answer: Question word order in an indirect question. Correct: "She asked where I put the keys.")*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Verb Pattern Analysis

Choose five verbs from the chapter and construct sentences showing:
- The type(s) of complement clause each takes
- Whether *that* can be omitted
- Any meaning differences with different complement types

### Activity 2: Academic Writing Style

Rewrite this informal passage using more formal complement clause structures (extraposition, *that* retained, appropriate complementizers):

*So everyone knows she was lying. What happened is still unclear. People are wondering if they should trust her again. The committee wants her to explain.*

### Activity 3: Reported Speech

Convert these direct quotes to reported speech using appropriate complement clauses:
1. *"I will finish the project tomorrow,"* she promised.
2. *"Where did you find this?"* he asked.
3. *"You should consult a specialist,"* the doctor advised.
4. *"Has the shipment arrived?"* the customer inquired.

---

## Chapter Summary

- **Complement clauses** (noun clauses) function as NPs—subjects, objects, subject complements, or complements to adjectives and nouns.

- **That-clauses** make statements; *that* is often omittable in object position but required in subject position.

- **Wh-clauses** (indirect questions) represent uncertain or questioned information; they use declarative word order.

- **Infinitive complements** express actions; some verbs take simple infinitives, others take object + infinitive.

- **Extraposition** moves heavy subject clauses to the end, using *it* as placeholder.

- **Subjunctive** (base form) appears after verbs of demand/suggestion and certain adjectives.

- Verb choice determines which complement type is possible and affects subtle meaning.

## Review Questions

1. What are the three main types of complement clauses? Give an example of each.

2. When must *that* be retained in a *that*-clause? When can it typically be omitted?

3. Explain the difference between *whether* and *if* in complement clauses. When is only *whether* acceptable?

4. What is extraposition, and why do writers use it?

5. What is the mandative subjunctive, and after which verbs does it occur? Give an example.

## Glossary

**Complement clause**: A dependent clause functioning as a noun phrase (subject, object, or complement); also called noun clause.

**Complementizer**: A word that introduces a complement clause (*that, whether, if*).

**Extraposition**: Moving a heavy subject clause to sentence-final position, with *it* as placeholder.

**Factive verb**: A verb that presupposes the truth of its complement (*know, realize, regret*).

**Infinitive complement**: A complement clause using *to* + base verb.

**Mandative subjunctive**: Use of the base verb form (regardless of subject) after verbs of demand, suggestion, etc.

**Raised subject**: A subject that appears in a higher clause but is semantically the subject of the embedded clause.

**That-clause**: A complement clause introduced by the complementizer *that*.

**Wh-clause**: A complement clause introduced by a wh-word, often representing an indirect question.
