## 12.1 The Two Core Parts: Subject and Predicate

Every complete sentence has two fundamental parts: a **subject** and a **predicate**.

### The Subject

The **subject** is what the sentence is about—typically who or what performs the action or is described. The subject is usually a noun phrase.

**Examples:**
- ***The tall man** walked slowly.*
- ***Three ambitious students from Pueblo** study hard.*
- ***Swimming** is fun.*

**Finding the subject:**
- Ask "Who or what [verb]?"
- *The tall man walked.* → Who walked? → *The tall man*

### The Predicate

The **predicate** is everything that is said about the subject. It always includes a verb phrase and may include objects, complements, and adverbials.

**Examples:**
- *The tall man **walked slowly**.*
- *Three students **study in the library**.*
- *She **is a talented musician**.*

**The predicate includes:**
- The main verb (required)
- Objects and complements (depending on verb type)
- Adverbials (optional)

### Diagramming Subject and Predicate

We can show the subject/predicate division with a vertical line:

```
      S
    __|__
   |     |
Subject  Predicate
  NP       VP
```

**The young artist | painted beautiful landscapes.**
- Subject: *The young artist*
- Predicate: *painted beautiful landscapes*

## 12.2 Complements: Objects and Subject Complements

**Complements** are elements required by the verb to complete the sentence's meaning. They differ from adverbials, which are optional.

### Direct Objects

The **direct object** receives the action of the verb. It answers "What?" or "Whom?"

**Examples:**
- *Weasels stalk **rabbits**.* (stalk what? → rabbits)
- *She read **the book**.* (read what? → the book)
- *I saw **him**.* (saw whom? → him)

Direct objects are always noun phrases (or clauses functioning as NPs).

### Indirect Objects

The **indirect object** indicates the recipient or beneficiary of the action. It answers "To whom?" or "For whom?"

**Examples:**
- *Marie sent **Ramon** a birthday gift.* (sent to whom? → Ramon)
- *She gave **me** the book.* (gave to whom? → me)
- *He told **the students** a story.* (told to whom? → the students)

Indirect objects:
- Appear between the verb and direct object
- Are always noun phrases
- Can be rephrased with *to* or *for*: *She gave the book **to me**.*

### Subject Complements

A **subject complement** describes or identifies the subject. It follows a linking verb (*be*, *become*, *seem*, *appear*, *feel*, etc.).

**Examples:**
- *I am **an optimist**.* (NP—identifies subject)
- *The writers are **very cold**.* (AdjP—describes subject)
- *He is **in trouble**.* (PP—describes subject)

Subject complements can be:
- Noun phrases: *She is **a nurse**.*
- Adjective phrases: *The trail looked **steep**.*
- Prepositional phrases: *He seems **in good spirits**.*

### Object Complements

An **object complement** describes or identifies the direct object. It follows certain transitive verbs.

**Examples:**
- *The director considered the performance **a success**.* (NP—identifies DO)
- *The critic called the acting **brilliant**.* (AdjP—describes DO)
- *They elected her **president**.* (NP—identifies DO)

Object complements can be:
- Noun phrases
- Adjective phrases

## 12.3 Arguments vs. Adverbials

Understanding the difference between **arguments** (required elements) and **adverbials** (optional elements) is crucial for sentence analysis.

### Arguments

**Arguments** are the elements that a verb requires to form a complete, grammatical sentence. They include:
- Subject (required for all sentences)
- Direct object (for transitive verbs)
- Indirect object (for ditransitive verbs)
- Subject complement (for linking verbs)
- Object complement (for some transitive verbs)

**Test:** If you remove an argument, the sentence becomes ungrammatical or changes meaning dramatically.

*She put the book on the table.*
- Remove *the book*: ~~*She put on the table.*~~ ✗
- Remove *on the table*: ~~*She put the book.*~~ ✗
- All three elements are arguments of *put*.

### Adverbials

**Adverbials** provide additional information about time, place, manner, reason, etc. They are optional—the sentence is grammatical without them.

**Examples:**
- *Accidents happen **on Mondays**.* (when)
- *She spoke **quietly**.* (how)
- ***Unfortunately**, we lost.* (attitude)

**Test:** If you remove an adverbial, the sentence remains grammatical.

*She spoke quietly in the library.*
- Remove *quietly*: *She spoke in the library.* ✓
- Remove *in the library*: *She spoke quietly.* ✓
- Both are adverbials—optional modifiers.

### Distinguishing Arguments from Adverbials

| Arguments | Adverbials |
|-----------|------------|
| Required by verb | Optional |
| Limited in number per verb | Unlimited |
| Cannot be moved as freely | Often movable |
| Removal changes grammaticality | Removal leaves grammatical sentence |

**Compare:**
- *She put the book **on the table**.* (argument—required by *put*)
- *She read the book **on the table**.* (adverbial—optional location)

## 12.4 Verb Valency

**Valency** refers to the number and types of arguments a verb requires. Different verbs have different valencies.

### Intransitive Verbs (Valency: 1)

Require only a subject:
- *Cameras **flashed**.*
- *The baby **slept**.*
- *Accidents **happen**.*

### Transitive Verbs (Valency: 2)

Require a subject and a direct object:
- *Weasels **stalk** rabbits.*
- *She **read** the book.*
- *They **completed** the project.*

### Ditransitive Verbs (Valency: 3)

Require a subject, direct object, and indirect object (or object complement):
- *Marie **sent** Ramon a gift.* (S + IO + DO)
- *She **gave** me the book.* (S + IO + DO)
- *The director **considered** the performance a success.* (S + DO + OC)

### Linking Verbs (Valency: 2)

Require a subject and subject complement:
- *She **is** a doctor.* (S + SC)
- *The trail **looked** steep.* (S + SC)
- *He **became** president.* (S + SC)

### Verbs with Variable Valency

Some verbs can be used with different valencies:

**Eat:**
- Intransitive: *We ate.* (1 argument)
- Transitive: *We ate dinner.* (2 arguments)

**Give:**
- Ditransitive: *She gave me a book.* (3 arguments)
- Transitive + PP: *She gave a book to me.* (2 arguments + adverbial)

## 12.5 Sentence Element Analysis

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find the main verb**
2. **Identify the subject** (NP before the verb)
3. **Identify adverbials** (optional time, place, manner elements—set these aside)
4. **Identify remaining elements** after the verb:
   - If noun phrase → object or complement
   - If adjective phrase → complement
   - If prepositional phrase → complement or adverbial (context-dependent)
5. **Determine verb type** based on elements required

### Example Analyses

**Sentence: The young artist painted beautiful landscapes.**

1. Main verb: *painted*
2. Subject: *The young artist*
3. Adverbials: none
4. Element after verb: *beautiful landscapes* (NP)
5. Verb type: Transitive → *beautiful landscapes* = direct object

**Sentence: Our horse is usually a darling on the trail.**

1. Main verb: *is*
2. Subject: *Our horse*
3. Adverbials: *usually* (frequency), *on the trail* (place)
4. Element after verb: *a darling* (NP)
5. Verb type: Copular be → *a darling* = subject complement

**Sentence: One tiny octopus showed me things about life.**

1. Main verb: *showed*
2. Subject: *One tiny octopus*
3. Adverbials: none
4. Elements after verb: *me* (NP), *things about life* (NP)
5. Verb type: Ditransitive → *me* = IO, *things about life* = DO

## Form and Function Tests

### Identifying Sentence Roles

| Role | Test |
|------|------|
| **Subject** | "Who/what [verb]?" |
| **Direct object** | "Verb what/whom?" |
| **Indirect object** | "Verb to/for whom?" |
| **Subject complement** | Describes/identifies subject after linking verb |
| **Object complement** | Describes/identifies DO after transitive verb |
| **Adverbial** | Optional; answers when/where/how/why |

### Complement vs. Adverbial PP

For prepositional phrases, determine if it's a complement or adverbial:

**Complement** (required):
- *He put the book **on the table**.* (required by *put*)
- *She relies **on her friends**.* (required by *rely*)

**Adverbial** (optional):
- *She read **in the library**.* (optional location)
- *We met **on Tuesday**.* (optional time)
