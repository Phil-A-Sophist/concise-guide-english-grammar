## 14.1 What Is a Compound Sentence?

A **compound sentence** contains two or more **independent clauses** joined through coordination. Each independent clause could function as a complete sentence on its own, but coordination shows that the ideas are related and equally important.

### Independent Clauses

An **independent clause** contains a subject and predicate and expresses a complete thought:
- *The power went out.*
- *We lit candles.*

Each could stand alone. Neither depends on the other to make sense.

### Creating Compound Sentences

When you join independent clauses, you create a **compound sentence** that shows a relationship between equally weighted ideas:

- *The power went out, **and** we lit candles.*
- *She applied for the position, **but** she didn't get an interview.*
- *The deadline passed; we submitted our work anyway.*

### Why Use Compound Sentences?

**To show relationships**: Compound sentences make connections between ideas explicit. *It started raining, so we went inside* tells readers that going inside was a consequence of the rain.

**To create flow**: A series of short simple sentences can feel choppy. Compare:
- *The concert ended. The crowd cheered. The band returned for an encore.* (choppy)
- *The concert ended, the crowd cheered, and the band returned for an encore.* (flowing)

**To give equal weight**: Unlike complex sentences, where one clause depends on another, compound sentences present ideas as equally important.

## 14.2 Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)

The most common method for creating compound sentences uses **coordinating conjunctions**. The acronym **FANBOYS** helps you remember them:

| Conjunction | Relationship | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **F**or | reason/cause | *We hurried home, **for** a storm was approaching.* |
| **A**nd | addition | *She writes poetry, **and** he composes music.* |
| **N**or | negative addition | *The store wasn't open, **nor** was anyone answering the phone.* |
| **B**ut | contrast | *I finished the book, **but** I didn't understand the ending.* |
| **O**r | alternative | *We can meet at noon, **or** we can reschedule for tomorrow.* |
| **Y**et | contrast (with surprise) | *The task seemed simple, **yet** it took all afternoon.* |
| **S**o | result/effect | *The restaurant was packed, **so** we ordered takeout.* |

### Punctuation Rule

When a coordinating conjunction joins two independent clauses, place a **comma before the conjunction**:

- *The lecture was fascinating**,** and I took detailed notes.*
- *She wanted to help**,** but she didn't know how.*

### Each Conjunction Explained

**For** (because, since):
- *They canceled the picnic, **for** rain was forecast.*
- Note: *For* sounds formal; *because* is more common in casual speech

**And** (in addition, also):
- *The musicians tuned their instruments, **and** the conductor raised the baton.*

**Nor** (and not, neither):
- *He didn't apologize, **nor** did he explain.*
- Note: *Nor* requires subject-verb inversion in the second clause

**But** (however, in contrast):
- *The critics panned the film, **but** audiences loved it.*

**Or** (alternatively, otherwise):
- *You can pay now, **or** you can be billed later.*

**Yet** (but still, nevertheless):
- *She had never trained formally, **yet** she painted beautifully.*
- Note: Implies something unexpected or surprising

**So** (therefore, as a result):
- *The bridge was closed, **so** we took the long route.*

### Check Your Understanding

Which FANBOYS conjunction fits best?

*The team practiced intensively, _____ they lost the championship.*

A. and
B. but
C. so

*(Answer: B—"but" shows contrast between expectation and outcome)*

## 14.3 Visualizing Compound Sentences

Tree diagrams reveal the structure of compound sentences clearly. Two complete sentences (S) connect through a conjunction at the top level.

### Compound Sentence Structure

![Tree diagram showing compound sentence structure](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-13-compound-sent.png)

*Figure 13.1: A compound sentence joins two independent clauses (each a complete S) through a coordinating conjunction. Both clauses have equal structural status.*

Notice that each clause has its own subject and verb phrase. The conjunction sits between them, creating a higher S node that encompasses both.

### Compound Subjects vs. Compound Sentences

Don't confuse compound sentences with **compound subjects**. A compound subject has two noun phrases sharing one predicate:

![Tree diagram showing compound subject](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-13-compound-subj.png)

*Figure 13.2: A compound subject joins two NPs within a single clause. This is NOT a compound sentence—there's only one verb phrase.*

- *Compound subject*: ***Marcus and Elena** traveled to Spain.* (one clause, one VP)
- *Compound sentence*: *Marcus traveled to Spain**, and** Elena stayed home.* (two clauses, two VPs)

### Compound Predicates vs. Compound Sentences

Similarly, a **compound predicate** has one subject with two verb phrases:

![Tree diagram showing compound predicate](assets/images/diagrams/renamed/diagram-13-compound-pred.png)

*Figure 13.3: A compound predicate joins two VPs sharing one subject. This is still a simple sentence, not a compound sentence.*

- *Compound predicate*: *The dog **barked loudly** and **chased the squirrel**.* (one subject, two VPs)
- *Compound sentence*: *The dog barked loudly**, and** the squirrel escaped.* (two subjects, two VPs)

### The Key Test

Ask: **Does each side of the conjunction have its own subject?**

- Yes → Compound sentence
- No → Simple sentence with compound element

## 14.4 Conjunctive Adverbs

**Conjunctive adverbs** (also called transitional expressions) offer another way to connect independent clauses. They show relationships more explicitly than coordinating conjunctions.

### Common Conjunctive Adverbs

| Relationship | Conjunctive Adverbs |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Addition | *moreover, furthermore, additionally, also, besides* |
| Contrast | *however, nevertheless, nonetheless, conversely, instead, on the other hand* |
| Result | *therefore, thus, consequently, hence, accordingly, as a result* |
| Time sequence | *meanwhile, subsequently, afterward, then, finally, next* |
| Example | *for example, for instance, specifically, in particular* |
| Emphasis | *indeed, certainly, in fact, undoubtedly* |
| Summary | *in summary, in conclusion, overall, in short* |

### Punctuation with Conjunctive Adverbs

Use a **semicolon before** and a **comma after** the conjunctive adverb:

- *The experiment failed**;** however**,** we learned from the results.*
- *She practiced every day**;** consequently**,** her performance improved dramatically.*

Alternatively, make them separate sentences with a **period**:

- *The experiment failed**.** However**,** we learned from the results.*

### Moveable Position

Unlike coordinating conjunctions (which must sit between clauses), conjunctive adverbs can move within their clause:

**Beginning**: *The roads were icy; **therefore**, we drove slowly.*
**Middle**: *The roads were icy; we, **therefore**, drove slowly.*
**End**: *The roads were icy; we drove slowly, **therefore**.*

The meaning stays the same, but the emphasis shifts slightly.

### Check Your Understanding

Punctuate correctly:

*The proposal was rejected _____ management reconsidered after receiving new data.*

A. , however,
B. ; however,
C. however;

*(Answer: B—semicolon before, comma after the conjunctive adverb)*

---

## 14.5 Other Coordination Methods

### Semicolon Alone

A **semicolon** can join closely related independent clauses without any conjunction:

- *The sun set**;** the temperature dropped.*
- *She excels at math**;** her brother prefers literature.*

Use this when:
- The relationship is clear from context
- You want a tighter connection than separate sentences
- The clauses are balanced or parallel in structure

### Colon for Elaboration

A **colon** can introduce a clause that explains, illustrates, or amplifies the first:

- *She had one goal**:** she wanted to finish before midnight.*
- *The verdict was unanimous**:** the defendant was guilty.*

The second clause typically explains or expands on something in the first.

---

## 14.6 Punctuation Errors to Avoid

### Comma Splice

A **comma splice** incorrectly uses only a comma to join independent clauses:

- ✗ *The museum closed early, we didn't get to see the exhibit.*

This is an error because a comma alone can't join independent clauses.

**Corrections:**
1. Add conjunction: *The museum closed early**,** **and** we didn't get to see the exhibit.*
2. Use semicolon: *The museum closed early**;** we didn't get to see the exhibit.*
3. Make two sentences: *The museum closed early**.** We didn't get to see the exhibit.*
4. Add conjunctive adverb: *The museum closed early**;** **consequently,** we didn't get to see the exhibit.*

### Run-on (Fused) Sentence

A **run-on sentence** joins independent clauses with no punctuation at all:

- ✗ *The museum closed early we didn't get to see the exhibit.*

**Corrections:** Same four options as for comma splices.

### When Commas Are Acceptable

**Short parallel clauses** (for rhetorical effect):
- *I came, I saw, I conquered.*

**Lists of brief clauses** (journalistic style):
- *The lights dimmed, the crowd hushed, the curtain rose.*

These are stylistic choices, not errors—but use them sparingly.

## 14.7 Parallel Structure in Coordination

When you coordinate elements, they should have the same grammatical form. This is called **parallel structure**.

### Correct Parallelism

**Coordinated nouns**:
- *She bought **apples**, **bread**, and **cheese**.* ✓

**Coordinated verbs**:
- *The child **laughed**, **clapped**, and **cheered**.* ✓

**Coordinated phrases**:
- *He enjoys **hiking in the mountains** and **swimming in the lake**.* ✓

**Coordinated clauses**:
- ***What you say** and **what you do** should match.* ✓

### Faulty Parallelism

When coordinated elements don't match in form, the sentence sounds awkward:

- ✗ *She enjoys **reading**, **to travel**, and **movies**.*
- ✓ *She enjoys **reading**, **traveling**, and **watching movies**.*

- ✗ *The job requires **patience**, **being organized**, and **dedication**.*
- ✓ *The job requires **patience**, **organization**, and **dedication**.*

### Correlative Conjunctions

Pairs like *both...and*, *either...or*, *neither...nor*, and *not only...but also* require especially careful parallelism:

- ✓ *She is **both** intelligent **and** hardworking.*
- ✗ *She is **both** intelligent **and** she works hard.*

- ✓ ***Either** we leave now **or** we miss the train.*
- ✗ ***Either** we should leave now **or** miss the train.*

### Check Your Understanding

Which sentence has correct parallel structure?

A. *The recipe calls for mixing flour, adding eggs, and butter.*
B. *The recipe calls for mixing flour, adding eggs, and blending butter.*

*(Answer: B—all three items are verb phrases)*

---

## 14.8 Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "And always needs a comma"

**Wrong**: Put a comma before every *and*.

**Right**: Only use a comma before *and* when it joins independent clauses:
- *She writes novels and short stories.* (no comma—compound object)
- *She writes novels, and he edits them.* (comma—compound sentence)

### Misconception 2: "Semicolons are interchangeable with commas"

**Wrong**: You can use semicolons wherever you'd use commas.

**Right**: Semicolons join independent clauses; commas (with FANBOYS) do too, but they serve different purposes. A semicolon suggests a closer relationship and doesn't specify the nature of the connection.

### Misconception 3: "Compound predicates need commas"

**Wrong**: *She opened the door, and walked inside.*

**Right**: *She opened the door and walked inside.* (No comma—this isn't a compound sentence; it's a simple sentence with compound predicate.)

### Misconception 4: "Starting with 'And' or 'But' is always wrong"

**Wrong**: Never begin a sentence with a conjunction.

**Right**: Starting with *And* or *But* is acceptable in modern usage, especially for emphasis. However, overuse can make writing feel fragmented.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identifying Compound Sentences

Mark each sentence as compound (C) or simple (S). If simple, identify whether it has a compound subject (CS), compound predicate (CP), or neither.

1. *The storm passed, and the sun emerged.*
2. *Marcus and Elena traveled across Europe.*
3. *She studied hard but still failed the exam.*
4. *She studied hard, but she still failed the exam.*
5. *The teacher explained the concept and answered questions.*
6. *The old clock on the mantle chimed twelve times.*

### Exercise 2: Choosing Conjunctions

Select the best FANBOYS conjunction for each sentence.

1. *The traffic was terrible, _____ we arrived on time.*
2. *You must register today, _____ you won't get a spot in the class.*
3. *He doesn't enjoy hiking, _____ does he like camping.*
4. *The play received mixed reviews, _____ it sold out every night.*
5. *We could fly to Chicago, _____ we could drive.*

### Exercise 3: Correcting Errors

Identify and correct any comma splices or run-ons.

1. *The deadline passed we submitted our application anyway.*
2. *She speaks three languages, her brother only speaks one.*
3. *The restaurant was crowded, however, we found a table.*
4. *He wanted to help but he didn't know how.*
5. *The project succeeded, everyone celebrated.*

### Exercise 4: Using Conjunctive Adverbs

Combine each pair using the indicated conjunctive adverb. Punctuate correctly.

1. *The evidence was compelling. The jury deliberated for hours.* (nevertheless)
2. *She practiced daily. Her technique improved dramatically.* (consequently)
3. *The budget was limited. We prioritized essential features.* (therefore)
4. *He claimed innocence. Witnesses placed him at the scene.* (however)

### Exercise 5: Fixing Parallelism

Revise each sentence to correct faulty parallelism.

1. *The manager values efficiency, being punctual, and dedication.*
2. *She not only sings beautifully but also she plays piano.*
3. *The course covers writing essays, how to give presentations, and research methods.*
4. *Either you complete the form online or by mail.*
5. *He enjoys both cooking elaborate meals and to eat at restaurants.*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Sentence Combining

Transform each group of simple sentences into one compound sentence using different methods. Write three versions: one with FANBOYS, one with a semicolon, and one with a conjunctive adverb.

**Example set**:
- *The meeting ran late. Everyone was hungry.*

**Versions**:
- *The meeting ran late, so everyone was hungry.* (FANBOYS)
- *The meeting ran late; everyone was hungry.* (semicolon)
- *The meeting ran late; consequently, everyone was hungry.* (conjunctive adverb)

**Your turn**:
1. *The printer jammed. We missed the deadline.*
2. *She offered to help. He refused.*
3. *The weather improved. We resumed our hike.*

### Activity 2: Error Hunt

Find and correct all comma splices and run-ons in this paragraph:

*The conference began on Monday it was scheduled to last three days. The keynote speaker was excellent, she discussed emerging trends in the field. Many attendees took notes, others recorded the sessions. The breakout sessions were popular, however, some rooms were overcrowded. Overall the event was successful everyone learned something new.*

### Activity 3: Style Revision

Revise this paragraph to improve flow by combining choppy sentences:

*The train was late. We waited on the platform. The wind was cold. We huddled together. Finally the train arrived. We boarded quickly. All the seats were taken. We had to stand. The journey took two hours. We were exhausted when we arrived.*
