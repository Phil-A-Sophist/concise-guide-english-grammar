## 26.1 What Is Rhetorical Grammar?

**Rhetorical grammar** is grammar in service of rhetoric—making strategic choices about structure to achieve communicative goals. It's not about correctness but effectiveness.

Grammar provides options. Style is choosing among them.

---

## 26.2 Sentence Types for Effect

### Short Sentences

Create emphasis, clarity, drama:
- *He left.*
- *Stop.*
- *Grammar matters.*

### Long Sentences

Develop complex ideas, create flow:
- *Although the committee had reviewed the proposal carefully, considering both its merits and its potential drawbacks, they ultimately decided, after much deliberation, to table the discussion for another meeting.*

### Mixing Lengths

Creates rhythm and emphasis:
- *He had everything. Money, power, influence, admiration. He had nothing that mattered.*

---

## 26.3 Sentence Patterns

### Cumulative (Loose) Sentences

Main clause first, then modifiers:
- *She walked into the room, **her head held high**, **her eyes scanning the crowd**, **looking for a familiar face**.*

**Effect:** Natural, flowing, exploratory

### Periodic Sentences

Modifiers first, main clause at end:
- ***Her head held high**, **her eyes scanning the crowd**, **looking for a familiar face**, she walked into the room.*

**Effect:** Suspense, climactic, formal

### Balanced Sentences

Parallel structures for comparison/contrast:
- *Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.*
- *Easy to learn, difficult to master.*

**Effect:** Memorable, forceful, polished

---

## 26.4 Register and Audience

### Formal Register

- Complex sentences
- Passive voice acceptable
- Full forms (do not, cannot)
- Technical vocabulary

### Informal Register

- Shorter sentences
- Active voice preferred
- Contractions
- Conversational vocabulary

### Adjusting for Audience

Consider:
- What does the audience know?
- What do they expect?
- What will persuade them?

---

## 26.5 Strategic Choices

### Active vs. Passive

**Active** for directness:
- *The committee rejected the proposal.*

**Passive** for diplomacy:
- *The proposal was not approved at this time.*

### Positive vs. Negative

**Positive** is usually clearer:
- ✗ *Do not forget to not leave the door unlocked.*
- ✓ *Remember to lock the door.*

### Subordination for Emphasis

What you subordinate, you de-emphasize:
- *Although she won the award, **she remained humble**.* (humility emphasized)
- *Although she remained humble, **she won the award**.* (award emphasized)

---

## 26.6 Developing Your Style

### Analyze Writers You Admire

- What sentence patterns do they use?
- How do they create rhythm?
- What makes their prose distinctive?

### Experiment

- Try different structures for the same content
- Read your writing aloud
- Revise for rhythm and emphasis

### Be Intentional

Every grammatical choice is a stylistic choice. Make them deliberately.

---

## 26.7 Putting It All Together

Effective writing combines:
- **Grammatical correctness** (foundation)
- **Clarity** (reader comprehension)
- **Coherence** (logical flow)
- **Style** (voice and effect)

Grammar knowledge gives you control. Style is exercising that control artfully.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sentence Type Effects

Write three versions of this information—as a short emphatic sentence, a cumulative sentence, and a periodic sentence:

*Information: She was determined to succeed despite all obstacles.*

### Exercise 2: Register Adjustment

Rewrite this formal sentence in an informal register:

*It is imperative that all participants refrain from utilizing cellular devices during the presentation.*

### Exercise 3: Subordination for Emphasis

Write two versions, emphasizing different information:

*Facts: John won the race. He had a broken ankle.*

### Exercise 4: Analyze a Passage

Find a paragraph from a writer you admire. Analyze:
- Sentence lengths and patterns
- Use of subordination
- Cumulative vs. periodic structure
- What makes the style effective?

## Final Thoughts

This textbook has taken you from the foundations of linguistics through the details of morphology, syntax, and sentence structure. But knowing grammar isn't the end—it's the beginning.

Grammar is a toolbox. The more tools you know how to use, the more precisely and effectively you can craft your ideas. Whether you're writing an email, an essay, or a novel, your grammatical knowledge gives you choices. And style is nothing more—and nothing less—than making those choices well.

Write clearly. Write purposefully. And above all, write with the confidence that comes from truly understanding how language works.
