## 24.1 Absolute Phrases

An **absolute phrase** (also called a **nominative absolute**) is a phrase that modifies an entire sentence rather than a single word. It consists of a noun phrase followed by a participle, adjective, or other modifier.

### Structure

**NP + modifier (participle, adjective, PP)**

Absolute phrases have their own subject (the NP) but no finite verb—they cannot stand alone as sentences.

### Types of Absolute Phrases

#### NP + Present Participle

The participle describes an ongoing action or state:

- ***Her hands trembling**, she opened the envelope.*
- ***The children laughing**, the parade continued down the street.*
- ***Rain falling steadily**, we decided to postpone the hike.*
- ***The audience watching intently**, the magician prepared his final trick.*

#### NP + Past Participle

The participle describes a completed action or resulting state:

- ***The work completed**, we celebrated with dinner.*
- ***His confidence shattered**, the candidate withdrew from the race.*
- ***The evidence examined**, the detective formed a theory.*
- ***All preparations made**, we waited for the guests to arrive.*

#### NP + Adjective

The adjective describes the state of the noun:

- ***Head high**, she walked into the interview.*
- ***Voice steady**, he delivered the difficult news.*
- ***Eyes wide**, the child stared at the fireworks.*
- ***Her expression unreadable**, the negotiator listened to their proposal.*

#### NP + Prepositional Phrase

A prepositional phrase modifies the noun:

- ***Camera in hand**, he explored the ancient ruins.*
- ***Notebook on her lap**, she recorded observations.*
- ***Arms across his chest**, he refused to budge.*
- ***Keys in the ignition**, she realized she'd forgotten her wallet.*

#### NP + Adverb

Less common, but possible:

- ***The game over**, spectators filed out of the stadium.*
- ***The meeting finally adjourned**, employees headed home.*

### Functions of Absolute Phrases

Absolutes typically express:

**Attendant circumstances** (what accompanies the main action):
- ***The moon rising**, we set out on our journey.*

**Cause or reason**:
- ***The bridge washed out**, we had to find an alternate route.*

**Time relationship**:
- ***The semester ended**, students scattered to their homes.*

**Condition**:
- ***Weather permitting**, the ceremony will be held outdoors.*

### Position in the Sentence

Absolutes can appear in various positions:

**Initial** (most common):
- ***His arguments exhausted**, the lawyer rested his case.*

**Final**:
- *She stepped onto the stage, **her heart pounding**.*

**Medial** (between subject and verb):
- *The ambassador, **his composure recovered**, continued his remarks.*

### Punctuation

Absolute phrases are **always set off by commas** (or dashes for emphasis):

- ***The storm approaching**, we secured the boats.*
- *The speaker continued, **voice rising with each point**.*
- *She arrived—**her dress torn, her hair disheveled**—and demanded an explanation.*

### Check Your Understanding

Identify the absolute phrase and what it expresses: *The negotiations stalled, we agreed to reconvene the following week.*

*(Answer: "The negotiations stalled" is the absolute phrase; it expresses cause/reason for reconvening)*

---

## 24.2 Cleft Sentences

**Cleft sentences** divide a simple sentence into two clauses to highlight or focus on a particular element. The "cleft" (split) allows speakers to control what information receives emphasis.

### Simple Sentence vs. Cleft

**Simple**: *John broke the window yesterday.*

This sentence can be "cleft" to focus on different parts:
- ***It was John** who broke the window yesterday.* (focus on John)
- ***It was the window** that John broke yesterday.* (focus on window)
- ***It was yesterday** that John broke the window.* (focus on time)

### It-Clefts

#### Structure

**It + be + focused element + that/who-clause**

The focused element is extracted from its normal position and placed after *be*; the rest becomes a relative clause.

#### Focusing on Different Elements

**Subject focus**:
- Simple: *The storm caused the damage.*
- Cleft: ***It was the storm** that caused the damage.*

**Object focus**:
- Simple: *She admires his dedication.*
- Cleft: ***It's his dedication** that she admires.*

**Adverbial focus**:
- Simple: *We met in Paris.*
- Cleft: ***It was in Paris** that we met.*

**Prepositional phrase focus**:
- Simple: *She argued with the manager.*
- Cleft: ***It was with the manager** that she argued.*

#### Negative It-Clefts

For emphasis in negation:
- ***It wasn't the cost** that concerned us—**it was the quality**.*
- ***It isn't talent** that matters most—**it's persistence**.*

#### Uses of It-Clefts

**Contrast**: *It wasn't Maria who complained—it was David.*
**Correction**: *Actually, it was Tuesday that we met, not Wednesday.*
**Emphasis**: *It's her integrity that I admire most.*
**Identifying new information**: *It was a passing motorist who called for help.*

### Wh-Clefts (Pseudo-Clefts)

#### Structure

**What-clause + be + focused element**

or the reverse order:

**Focused element + be + what-clause**

#### Basic Pattern

- Simple: *I need a vacation.*
- Wh-cleft: ***What I need** is **a vacation**.*
- Reverse: ***A vacation** is **what I need**.*

#### More Examples

- ***What concerns me** is **the lack of communication**.*
- ***What they decided** was **to postpone the launch**.*
- ***What happened** was **a complete system failure**.*

#### Variations with Other Wh-Words

While *what* is most common, other wh-words are possible:

- ***Where we're going** is **a surprise**.* (place)
- ***How she succeeded** was **through persistence**.* (manner)
- ***Why he resigned** is **what puzzles me**.* (reason)

**The person/thing/place who/that...** constructions:
- ***The person who helped us** was **a complete stranger**.*
- ***The thing that bothers me** is **their attitude**.*

#### All-Clefts

Using *all* for emphasis:
- ***All I want** is **some peace and quiet**.*
- ***All they did** was **complain**.*

### Choosing Between It-Clefts and Wh-Clefts

**It-clefts** are better for:
- Focusing on subjects or adverbials
- Contrastive emphasis
- Short focused elements

**Wh-clefts** are better for:
- Focusing on objects or complements
- Introducing new information
- When the focused element is long

### Check Your Understanding

Create an it-cleft to focus on "last Tuesday": *The accident happened last Tuesday.*

*(Answer: "It was last Tuesday that the accident happened.")*

## 24.3 Existential There

**Existential *there*** is a grammatical device used to introduce new entities into the discourse. It differs from locative *there* (referring to a place).

### Structure

**There + be + NP (+ optional location/time)**

- ***There is** a message for you.*
- ***There are** several options available.*
- ***There was** an accident on the highway.*
- ***There have been** complaints about the noise.*

### Existential vs. Locative There

**Existential** (introducing something new):
- ***There** is a book on the table.* (*there* is grammatical placeholder)

**Locative** (pointing to a place):
- *The book is **there**, on the table.* (*there* = that location)

**Test**: In existential sentences, *there* is unstressed and cannot be replaced with *here*. Locative *there* is stressed and can be contrasted with *here*.

### Functions

#### Introducing New Entities

Existential *there* introduces previously unknown information:

- ***There** was a stranger at the door.*
- ***There** are some questions I'd like to ask.*
- ***There** will be an announcement tomorrow.*

#### Asserting Existence

- ***There** is no excuse for such behavior.*
- ***There** exists a solution to this problem.*
- ***There** remains one unresolved issue.*

#### Listing Items

- ***There** are three points to consider: cost, quality, and timing.*
- ***There** were several factors that contributed: weather, timing, and luck.*

### Subject-Verb Agreement

The verb agrees with the **NP following *there*** (the "notional subject"):

- ***There is** a problem.* (singular)
- ***There are** problems.* (plural)
- ***There has been** a delay.* (singular)
- ***There have been** delays.* (plural)

**Note**: In informal speech, singular *there's* often precedes plural nouns (*There's three options*), but this is non-standard in formal writing.

### Definiteness Restriction

Existential *there* typically introduces **indefinite NPs** (new information):

**Natural**: *There is **a book** on the table.*
**Awkward**: *?There is **the book** on the table.* (definite—already known)

**Exception**: Definite NPs work in list contexts:
- *There's **the cost**, **the schedule**, and **the staffing** to consider.*

### Verbs Other Than Be

While *be* is most common, other verbs work with existential *there*:

**Existence**: *There **exists** a solution.*
**Remaining**: *There **remains** one question.*
**Appearing**: *There **appeared** a figure in the doorway.*
**Arising**: *There **arose** a dispute over ownership.*

### Variations

**There + modal + be**:
- *There **might be** a delay.*
- *There **should be** enough time.*
- *There **could have been** a mistake.*

**There + be + NP + present participle**:
- *There were **children playing** in the yard.*
- *There's **someone knocking** at the door.*

### Check Your Understanding

Why is this sentence awkward? *There is my car in the driveway.*

*(Answer: "My car" is definite/known. Existential there introduces new information. Better: "My car is in the driveway.")*

---

## 24.4 Subject-Verb Inversion

**Inversion** places the verb (or auxiliary) before the subject, reversing the normal English word order. Different types of inversion serve different purposes.

### Subject-Auxiliary Inversion

The **auxiliary** moves before the subject (the main verb stays in place):

#### After Negative or Restrictive Adverbials

When a negative or restrictive adverbial begins the sentence:

- ***Never** have I witnessed such dedication.*
- ***Rarely** does she complain about anything.*
- ***Seldom** had the committee seen such a proposal.*
- ***Not once** did he apologize.*
- ***Under no circumstances** should you open that door.*
- ***Not only** did she win, but she also broke the record.*
- ***Only then** did we realize the significance.*
- ***Only after** careful review **did** we approve the request.*
- ***Little** did they know what awaited them.*
- ***Nowhere** could we find the missing documents.*
- ***In no way** does this represent our official position.*

**Note**: Without the initial negative adverbial, normal order applies:
- *She rarely complains about anything.* (normal order)

#### In Conditional Clauses Without If

Formal/literary style omits *if* and uses inversion:

- ***Had** I known, I would have helped.* (= If I had known)
- ***Were** she here, she would agree.* (= If she were here)
- ***Should** you need assistance, call this number.* (= If you should need)

These inversions sound formal and are common in written English.

#### After So/Neither/Nor (Agreement)

To express agreement with a previous statement:

- *"I enjoyed the film." "**So did I**."*
- *"She hasn't finished." "**Neither have I**."*
- *"He can't attend." "**Nor can I**."*

### Subject-Verb Inversion (Full Inversion)

The **entire verb** (not just auxiliary) moves before the subject:

#### After Locative or Directional Adverbials

Common with verbs of existence, position, or motion:

- ***Here** comes the bus.*
- ***There** goes my last chance.*
- ***Down** came the rain.*
- ***Up** rose the balloon.*
- ***On the table** sat a vase of flowers.*
- ***At the end of the road** stands an old church.*
- ***Beyond the mountains** lay a hidden valley.*

**Note**: This inversion typically doesn't occur with pronouns:
- *Here **comes the bus**.* (full NP—inversion)
- *Here **it comes**.* (pronoun—no inversion)

#### After Direct Speech

In dialogue attribution:

- *"I disagree," **said the senator**.*
- *"Let's begin," **suggested Maria**.*
- *"What happened?" **asked the detective**.*

**Note**: Inversion is optional; normal order works too:
- *"I disagree," **the senator said**.*

### Functions of Inversion

**Emphasis**: Placing negative adverbs initially creates dramatic emphasis.
**End-focus**: Inversion keeps the "heavy" or important information at the end.
**Cohesion**: Locative inversion links to previous context.
**Formality**: Conditional inversion signals formal register.

### Check Your Understanding

Rewrite using inversion after the negative adverb: *We have never seen such an outcome.*

*(Answer: "Never have we seen such an outcome.")*

---

## 24.5 Fronting

**Fronting** moves an element to sentence-initial position for emphasis or to establish topic. Unlike inversion, fronting doesn't change the subject-verb order.

### Fronted Objects

Direct objects can move to the front for emphasis:

- ***This problem**, we cannot ignore.*
- ***His proposal**, the committee rejected outright.*
- ***Such behavior**, I will not tolerate.*
- ***That much**, I can promise you.*

### Fronted Complements

Subject complements can be fronted:

- ***Brilliant** she may be, but she lacks experience.*
- ***A fine musician** he certainly is.*
- ***Happy** they were not, despite the good news.*

### Fronted Adverbials

Adverbials often appear initially (this is common and doesn't create strong fronting effect):

- ***Yesterday**, we finished the project.*
- ***In the morning**, I'll call you.*
- ***With great care**, she unwrapped the package.*

### Fronting for Contrast

Fronting often creates contrast with what was expected:

- ***Him** I trust; **her** I don't.*
- ***Some days** I feel optimistic; **other days**, not so much.*

### Check Your Understanding

What element is fronted and why? *These instructions, no one could follow.*

*(Answer: "These instructions" (direct object) is fronted for emphasis—highlighting the problematic nature of the instructions)*

---

## 24.6 Using These Constructions Effectively

### For Emphasis and Focus

**Clefts** for identifying and contrasting:
- *It was her **perseverance**, not her talent, that led to success.*

**Inversion** for dramatic effect:
- *Never had the audience witnessed such a performance.*

**Fronting** for topicalization:
- *That argument, we've already addressed.*

### For Information Structure

**Existential *there*** for introducing new entities:
- *There was a knock at the door.* (introduces the knock)

**Clefts** for connecting old and new information:
- *It was the economic downturn that caused the layoffs.* (connects known layoffs to new cause)

### For Stylistic Variety

**Absolutes** add descriptive richness:
- *The speech concluded, applause filled the auditorium.*

**Fronting** varies sentence patterns:
- *Such an opportunity, she realized, might never come again.*

### When to Avoid These Constructions

**Overuse**: Too many special constructions make writing feel artificial.

**Unnecessary complexity**: Don't cleft a sentence when simple order works:
- Awkward: *It was a coffee that I ordered.*
- Natural: *I ordered a coffee.*

**Wrong register**: Inverted conditionals sound too formal for casual writing.

**Ambiguity**: Ensure fronted elements clearly relate to the sentence.

### Check Your Understanding

Why might this cleft sentence be unnecessary? *It was at 3 PM that the meeting started.*

*(Answer: The focus on "3 PM" isn't particularly meaningful unless contrasting with another time. "The meeting started at 3 PM" is simpler.)*

---

## 24.7 Common Errors and Misconceptions

### Error 1: Dangling Absolutes

Like other modifiers, absolutes must have a clear referent:

**Dangling**: *The presentation finished, refreshments were served.*
(Who finished the presentation? The sentence implies "refreshments" did.)

**Clear**: *The presentation finished, we served refreshments.*
or *The presentation finished, the host served refreshments.*

### Error 2: Subject-Verb Agreement with Existential There

**Incorrect**: *There's many reasons to celebrate.*
**Correct**: *There **are** many reasons to celebrate.*

The verb agrees with the following NP.

### Error 3: Using That in Wh-Clefts

**Incorrect**: *What I need is **that** I get more sleep.*
**Correct**: *What I need is **to get** more sleep.* or *What I need is **more sleep**.*

The focused element should be an NP, infinitive, or similar—not a *that*-clause.

### Error 4: Incomplete Inversion

**Incorrect**: *Never I have seen such a thing.*
**Correct**: *Never **have I** seen such a thing.*

After negative adverbs, the auxiliary must move before the subject.

### Error 5: Inversion with Pronouns After Locatives

**Incorrect**: *Here comes **he**.*
**Correct**: *Here **he comes**.*

Locative inversion typically doesn't occur with pronouns.

### Misconception: "There is/are" Is Always Bad Style

**Myth**: Avoid "there is/are" constructions.

**Reality**: Existential *there* serves important discourse functions. It's problematic when overused or when a more direct construction would be clearer, but it's a legitimate grammatical structure.

**Appropriate**: *There is one issue we haven't addressed.*
**Unnecessarily indirect**: *There is a need for us to discuss this matter.* → *We need to discuss this.*

### Check Your Understanding

What's the error? *Rarely does she is late for meetings.*

*(Answer: Incorrect auxiliary. "Does" is already the auxiliary, so the main verb should be base form: "Rarely is she late for meetings." or keep "does" and change structure: "Rarely does she arrive late.")*

## Application Activities

### Activity 1: Stylistic Analysis

Find a passage from a novel or news article. Identify any:
- Absolute phrases
- Cleft sentences
- Existential *there* constructions
- Inverted structures

Analyze why the writer chose each construction. What effect does it create?

### Activity 2: Revision for Variety

Revise this paragraph to add variety using at least two different constructions from this chapter:

*A problem existed with the original plan. The budget concerned the committee most. Nobody had anticipated the costs. The team never considered an alternative.*

### Activity 3: Register Transformation

Rewrite this informal passage in a more formal style using appropriate constructions:

*There was this guy at the door. He wanted to talk about the problem. Nobody knew what happened. Then we figured it out—it was the software, not the hardware.*

### Activity 4: Focus and Emphasis

Write three versions of a sentence announcing the winner of an award:
1. Using a simple declarative
2. Using an it-cleft
3. Using a wh-cleft

Discuss when each version would be most appropriate.

---

## Chapter Summary

- **Absolute phrases** (NP + modifier) modify entire sentences, expressing attendant circumstances, cause, time, or condition; they require commas.

- **Cleft sentences** (*It was X that...*, *What I need is...*) split a sentence to focus on a particular element for emphasis or contrast.

- **Existential *there*** introduces new entities into discourse; the verb agrees with the following NP, not with *there*.

- **Inversion** places verb/auxiliary before subject for emphasis (after negative adverbs), in conditional clauses without *if*, and after locative adverbials.

- **Fronting** moves elements to initial position for emphasis or topic establishment.

- These constructions control information flow, emphasis, and stylistic variety; use them purposefully, not excessively.

## Review Questions

1. What is an absolute phrase, and how does it differ from a participial phrase?

2. Compare it-clefts and wh-clefts. When might you prefer one over the other?

3. What is the "definiteness restriction" with existential *there*? Why does *There is a book on the table* sound natural, but *There is my book on the table* sounds awkward?

4. After which types of initial elements does subject-auxiliary inversion occur? Give examples.

5. How do these special constructions help writers control information structure and reader focus?
