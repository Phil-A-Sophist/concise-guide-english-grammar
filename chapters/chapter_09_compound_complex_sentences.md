## 9.1 Sentence Types Overview

English sentences can be classified by structure:

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Simple** | One independent clause | *The dog barked.* |
| **Compound** | Two+ independent clauses | *The dog barked, and the cat hid.* |
| **Complex** | One independent + one+ dependent clause | *The dog barked when the mail arrived.* |
| **Compound-complex** | Two+ independent + one+ dependent clause | *The dog barked when the mail arrived, and the cat hid under the bed.* |

Understanding these structures allows you to vary your prose and convey relationships between ideas effectively.

---

## 9.2 Simple Sentences

A **simple sentence** contains one independent clause—a subject-predicate unit that expresses a complete thought.

*The students studied.*
*My neighbor's talented daughter won the competition last week.*

Simple sentences can be long if they have compound subjects, compound predicates, or extensive modification:

- **Compound subject**: *Marcus **and** Elena traveled to Spain.* (still simple—one predicate)
- **Compound predicate**: *The dog **barked** and **chased** the squirrel.* (still simple—one subject)
- **Heavy modification**: *The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya collapsed at the finish line.* (still simple—one clause)

---

## 9.3 Compound Sentences

A **compound sentence** contains two or more **independent clauses** joined through coordination. Each clause could stand alone, but coordination shows the ideas are related.

### Creating Compound Sentences

Independent clauses can be joined by:

1. **Coordinating conjunction** (with comma): *The power went out, and we lit candles.*
2. **Semicolon**: *The power went out; we lit candles.*
3. **Semicolon + conjunctive adverb**: *The power went out; therefore, we lit candles.*

### Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)

The acronym **FANBOYS** helps you remember the seven coordinating conjunctions:

| Conjunction | Relationship | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **F**or | reason/cause | *We hurried home, **for** a storm was approaching.* |
| **A**nd | addition | *She writes poetry, **and** he composes music.* |
| **N**or | negative addition | *The store wasn't open, **nor** was anyone answering.* |
| **B**ut | contrast | *I finished the book, **but** I didn't understand it.* |
| **O**r | alternative | *We can meet at noon, **or** we can reschedule.* |
| **Y**et | contrast (surprising) | *The task seemed simple, **yet** it took hours.* |
| **S**o | result/effect | *The restaurant was packed, **so** we ordered takeout.* |

**Punctuation rule**: Place a **comma before** the conjunction when it joins two independent clauses:

*The lecture was fascinating**,** and I took detailed notes.*

### Conjunctive Adverbs

**Conjunctive adverbs** offer another way to connect independent clauses with more explicit relationships:

| Relationship | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Addition | *moreover, furthermore, additionally, also* |
| Contrast | *however, nevertheless, nonetheless, instead* |
| Result | *therefore, thus, consequently, hence* |
| Time | *meanwhile, subsequently, afterward, then* |
| Example | *for example, for instance, specifically* |

**Punctuation**: Use a **semicolon before** and **comma after** the conjunctive adverb:

*The experiment failed**;** however**,** we learned from the results.*

### Compound vs. Compound Elements

Don't confuse compound sentences with simple sentences containing compound elements:

| Structure | Example | Type |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Compound subject | *Marcus **and** Elena traveled.* | Simple (one VP) |
| Compound predicate | *The dog **barked and chased** the squirrel.* | Simple (one subject) |
| Compound sentence | *Marcus traveled, **and** Elena stayed.* | Compound (two clauses) |

**Test**: Does each side of the conjunction have its own subject? If yes → compound sentence.

---

## 9.4 Complex Sentences

A **complex sentence** contains one independent clause and at least one **dependent (subordinate) clause**. Unlike compound sentences, complex sentences create a hierarchy—one idea is primary, another is supporting.

### Independent vs. Dependent Clauses

An **independent clause** expresses a complete thought:
- *The power flickered.*
- *Everyone looked up.*

A **dependent clause** has a subject and predicate but cannot stand alone:
- ***When** the power flickered* (What happened?)
- ***That** everyone noticed* (What about it?)

The subordinating word (*when*, *that*, *because*, *who*) transforms an independent clause into a dependent one.

### Creating Complex Sentences

*Everyone looked up **when the power flickered**.*
*The fact **that everyone noticed** surprised the speaker.*

The dependent clause provides context, explanation, or specification for the main clause.

### Why Use Complex Sentences?

- **Show relationships**: Causal, temporal, and conditional connections become explicit
- **Emphasize main ideas**: Subordinating less important information guides readers
- **Create sophisticated prose**: Varied structures make writing more engaging

---

## 9.5 Types of Dependent Clauses

Dependent clauses are classified by their grammatical function.

### Adverb Clauses (Adverbial Clauses)

**Adverb clauses** modify verbs, adjectives, or sentences, answering questions like *when?*, *why?*, *under what conditions?*

**Time**:
- *We celebrated **when the results came in**.*
- ***After the concert ended**, the crowd dispersed.*

**Reason**:
- *She declined **because she had other plans**.*
- ***Since you asked**, I'll explain.*

**Contrast**:
- ***Although the evidence was strong**, the jury was skeptical.*
- *The project succeeded **even though we faced obstacles**.*

**Condition**:
- ***If the weather improves**, we'll go hiking.*
- *I won't sign **unless you modify the contract**.*

### Relative Clauses (Adjective Clauses)

**Relative clauses** modify nouns, specifying which person, thing, or place is meant. They're introduced by relative pronouns (*who*, *whom*, *which*, *that*, *whose*) or relative adverbs (*where*, *when*, *why*).

- *The candidate **who impressed the committee** received the position.*
- *The novel **that won the award** explores identity.*
- *This is the park **where we first met**.*

**Restrictive vs. Non-restrictive**:

- **Restrictive** (essential): *The students **who studied** passed.* (specifies which students)
- **Non-restrictive** (additional info): *My sister, **who lives in Boston**, visited.* (adds information about the only sister)

Non-restrictive clauses are set off with commas.

### Noun Clauses

**Noun clauses** function as noun phrases—subjects, objects, or complements. They're introduced by *that*, *whether*, *if*, or wh-words.

**As subject**: ***That she resigned** shocked the board.*
**As direct object**: *I understand **that you're frustrated**.*
**As complement**: *The problem is **that we underestimated demand**.*

---

## 9.6 Subordinating Conjunctions

**Subordinating conjunctions** introduce adverb clauses and specify relationships:

| Relationship | Subordinating Conjunctions |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Time** | *when, while, before, after, until, since, as, once, whenever, as soon as* |
| **Cause/Reason** | *because, since, as, given that, now that* |
| **Contrast** | *although, though, even though, while, whereas, even if* |
| **Condition** | *if, unless, provided that, in case, assuming that, as long as* |
| **Purpose** | *so that, in order that* |
| **Manner** | *as, as if, as though* |

---

## 9.7 Punctuation in Compound and Complex Sentences

### Compound Sentences

**With coordinating conjunction**: comma before conjunction
- *It rained, **and** we stayed inside.*

**With semicolon only**: no conjunction needed
- *It rained; we stayed inside.*

**With conjunctive adverb**: semicolon before, comma after
- *It rained; **therefore,** we stayed inside.*

### Complex Sentences

**Dependent clause first**: comma after the clause
- ***When it rained,** we stayed inside.*

**Dependent clause last**: usually no comma
- *We stayed inside **when it rained**.*

**Non-restrictive relative clauses**: commas around
- *My brother, **who lives in Seattle**, visited.*

**Restrictive relative clauses**: no commas
- *The brother **who lives in Seattle** visited.*

---

## 9.8 Common Errors: Comma Splices and Run-Ons

### Comma Splices

A **comma splice** joins two independent clauses with only a comma (no conjunction):

*~~The concert ended, the crowd cheered.~~* ✗

**Fixes**:
- Add conjunction: *The concert ended, **and** the crowd cheered.*
- Use semicolon: *The concert ended; the crowd cheered.*
- Make two sentences: *The concert ended. The crowd cheered.*
- Subordinate: ***When** the concert ended, the crowd cheered.*

### Run-On Sentences (Fused Sentences)

A **run-on** joins independent clauses with no punctuation:

*~~The concert ended the crowd cheered.~~* ✗

**Fixes**: Same as comma splices.

---

## 9.9 Choosing Between Coordination and Subordination

### When to Coordinate

Use compound sentences when ideas are:
- **Equally important**: *She applied, and she got the job.*
- **Contrasting equally**: *It looked easy, but it was difficult.*
- **Part of a sequence**: *He entered, he looked around, and he left.*

### When to Subordinate

Use complex sentences when:
- **One idea supports another**: *She got the job **because she prepared well**.*
- **You want to emphasize the main clause**: ***Although it was difficult**, she succeeded.*
- **Showing time, cause, or condition**: *Call me **if you need help**.*

### Combining Both

**Compound-complex sentences** combine coordination and subordination:

*The dog barked **when the mail arrived**, **and** the cat hid under the bed.*

This shows temporal relationships (complex) while presenting two reactions as equal (compound).

c) Which version (coordination or subordination) would you choose if you wanted to present both ideas as equally important? Explain.

---

**17.** Read the following passage and answer the questions:

*When the storm began, the hikers sought shelter. They found a small cave, and they waited there for hours. Although they were cold and hungry, they remained calm because they had prepared for emergencies.*

a) Identify all independent and dependent clauses in the passage:

Independent clauses:

Dependent clauses (and their types):

b) How many sentences are in this passage, and what type is each?

---

**18.** In 3-4 sentences, explain when a writer should choose coordination over subordination (or vice versa). What effect does each choice have on emphasis and the relationship between ideas? Provide an example to illustrate your point.

---

*Total estimated time: 30-40 minutes*

## Chapter Summary

- **Simple sentences** contain one independent clause.
- **Compound sentences** join independent clauses through coordination (FANBOYS, semicolons, conjunctive adverbs).
- **Complex sentences** combine an independent clause with dependent clause(s) through subordination.
- **Dependent clauses** are classified as adverb (modify verbs), relative (modify nouns), or noun (function as NPs).
- **Coordinating conjunctions** (FANBOYS) show relationships between equal ideas.
- **Subordinating conjunctions** introduce dependent clauses showing time, cause, contrast, condition, etc.
- **Comma splices** and **run-ons** are errors that can be fixed by proper punctuation or restructuring.
- Choose coordination for equal ideas; choose subordination to emphasize the main clause.
