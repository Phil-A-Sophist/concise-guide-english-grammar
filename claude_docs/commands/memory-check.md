Run a full health check on this project's memory system. Do not make any changes — this is a read-only diagnostic.

Check the following:

1. Does `.memory/` exist? List all files and folders present.
2. Verify the standard folder structure: state.md, project-map.md, knowledge-base.md, scripts/, reference/, templates/, logs/, downloads/, sub/
3. Report any missing folders or files that should exist.
4. Read state.md — report the current task count and last update date.
5. Check all downloads/ folders (root and sub-projects) for unrouted items.
6. List all snapshot files (state-t*.md) and their task numbers.
7. Check each sub-project compartment has project-map.md and knowledge-base.md.
8. If this is a git repo, report the current branch and whether there are uncommitted changes.

Summarize: what's healthy, what needs attention, and any recommended actions.
