# Project State

Task: 7
Last updated: 2026-02-12

## Overview
"A Concise Guide to English Grammar" is an open educational resource (OER) college textbook on English grammar, authored in PreTeXt XML (21 chapters) and published as HTML via GitHub Pages and as an EPUB ebook.

## Active Threads
- **Language example formatting rollout in progress** — Chapter 6 completed and approved. STYLE_GUIDE.md comprehensively documents the Language Example Formatting System. Rollout to remaining chapters (1-5, 7-21) now beginning with Chapter 1.
  - Formatting rules: `<foreign>` for all language examples (sans-serif, 0.9em), `<q><foreign>` for inline examples, parentheses only for grouped multiples, `<delete>` for ungrammatical, `<em>` for emphasis only
  - Quick reference table and CSS behavior in STYLE_GUIDE.md ready for implementation

## Next Steps
- Chapter 1 formatting review and application
- Sequence remainder of chapters 2-5, then 7-21
- Track completion status as rollout progresses

## Open Questions
- Answer keys exist only for Chapters 4-15; Chapters 1-3 and 16-21 may still need them
- The REVISION_AUDIT.md references an older 27-chapter structure; update needed to reflect current 21-chapter organization

## Notes
Chapter 6 formatting complete and approved. Style guide updated with comprehensive Language Example Formatting System. Ready to begin rollout phase with Chapter 1.
