# Project State

Task: 8
Last updated: 2026-02-12

## Overview
"A Concise Guide to English Grammar" is an open educational resource (OER) college textbook on English grammar, authored in PreTeXt XML (21 chapters) and published as HTML via GitHub Pages and as an EPUB ebook.

## Active Threads
- **Language example formatting rollout in progress** — Chapter 6 (pilot) and Chapter 1 both completed and committed. STYLE_GUIDE.md comprehensively documents the Language Example Formatting System. Rollout to remaining chapters (2-5, 7-21) continues.
  - Formatting rules: `<foreign>` for all language examples (sans-serif, 0.9em), `<q><foreign>` for inline examples, parentheses only for grouped multiples, `<delete>` for ungrammatical, `<em>` for emphasis only
  - Quick reference table and CSS behavior in STYLE_GUIDE.md ready for implementation

## Completed Recently
- Chapter 1 language example formatting applied (2026-02-12)
- Chapter 6 language example formatting completed and approved (pilot chapter)
- STYLE_GUIDE.md updated with comprehensive Language Example Formatting System

## Next Steps
- Continue formatting rollout: Chapters 2-5, then 7-21
- Track completion status as rollout progresses

## Open Questions
- Answer keys exist only for Chapters 4-15; Chapters 1-3 and 16-21 may still need them
- The REVISION_AUDIT.md references an older 27-chapter structure; update needed to reflect current 21-chapter organization
