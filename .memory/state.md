## Active Threads
None identified — memory initialized from existing project scan.

## Open Questions
- Answer keys exist only for Chapters 4-15; Chapters 1-3 and 16-21 may still need them
- The REVISION_AUDIT.md references an older 27-chapter structure; it has not been updated to reflect the current 21-chapter organization
- Several chapters (particularly later ones covering advanced structures and applied grammar) may still need content expansion per the audit
