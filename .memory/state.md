# Project State

Task: 17
Last updated: 2026-02-14

## Overview
"A Concise Guide to English Grammar" is an open educational resource (OER) college textbook on English grammar, authored in PreTeXt XML (21 chapters) and published as HTML via GitHub Pages and as an EPUB ebook.

## Active Threads
- **Chapter 7 style guide compliance** — Applying `<foreign>` formatting to language examples throughout Chapter 7. This was deferred during Task 16's structural revision; now being addressed.
- **Chapter 7 homework formatting and Word file generation** — Fixing homework formatting in PreTeXt and generating updated Word (.docx) files for student download.
- **Language example formatting rollout** — Chapters 1-6 completed. Chapter 7 in progress (this task). Chapters 8-21 pending.

## Completed Recently
- **Task 16: Chapter 7 major structural revision** — Complete overhaul with 10 PNG diagrams, new sections (Sentence Labeling Tables, Step-by-Step Sentence Analysis), updated homework Parts 3-5, expanded glossary, revised learning objectives. All committed and pushed.
- **Tasks 8-15: Language example formatting** — Chapters 1-6 formatted with `<foreign>` element per STYLE_GUIDE.md. Committed and pushed.
- **Bracket notation reference** — 10 new ch07 entries added; old ch07 VP entries preserved for cross-chapter references.

## Next Steps
- Complete Chapter 7 `<foreign>` formatting and homework fixes (this task)
- Resume language example formatting: Chapter 8 onwards
- Build HTML/EPUB after changes
- Commit and push
- Monitor diagram integration needs for remaining chapters

## Notes
- **Snapshot reminder:** No snapshots exist yet (Task 10 was missed). Create `state-t20.md` at Task 20.
- Temporary Word lock file (~$it Two Sentence Labeling Handout.docx) may remain untracked; can be ignored.
