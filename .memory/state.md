# Project State

Task: 18
Last updated: 2026-02-14

## Overview
"A Concise Guide to English Grammar" is an open educational resource (OER) college textbook on English grammar, authored in PreTeXt XML (21 chapters) and published as HTML via GitHub Pages and as an EPUB ebook.

## Active Threads
- **Systematic chapter improvement** — Working through chapters one at a time. Process documented in `.memory/chapter-improvement-process.md`. Each chapter gets: diagram audit, `<foreign>` formatting, homework review/fixes, Word file generation, build+push.
- **Chapter 8 improvement (IN PROGRESS)** — Beginning the full improvement process for Chapter 8 (Basic Sentence Elements and Sentence Patterns). Steps: diagram audit (ch08_* PNGs exist in assets/diagrams/new/), `<foreign>` conversion, homework review/fixes, Word file generation, build+push.
- **Language example formatting rollout** — Chapters 1-7 completed. Chapter 8 is next.
- **Homework difficulty calibration** — Chapters 8+ homework was flagged as too difficult. Model after ch4-7 patterns (15-25 exercises, identification-heavy, scaffolded examples).

## Completed in Task 17
- Chapter 7 `<foreign>` conversion, homework formatting, Word files (Homework, Answer Key, Overhead)
- Process documentation created: `.memory/chapter-improvement-process.md`

## Next Steps
- Complete Chapter 8 improvement (diagram audit, `<foreign>`, homework, Word files, build+push)
- Continue to Chapter 9 after Chapter 8 is done

## Notes
- **Snapshot reminder:** Create `state-t20.md` at Task 20. No snapshots exist yet.
- **Pre-existing unstaged changes:** PNG diagram files (ch08-ch16) and regenerated homework .docx files (all chapters) remain unstaged. Only commit target chapter's files.
