# Project State

Task: 19
Last updated: 2026-02-14

## Overview
"A Concise Guide to English Grammar" is an open educational resource (OER) college textbook on English grammar, authored in PreTeXt XML (21 chapters) and published as HTML via GitHub Pages and as an EPUB ebook.

## Active Threads
- **Systematic chapter improvement** — Working through chapters one at a time. Process documented in `.memory/chapter-improvement-process.md`. Each chapter gets: diagram audit, `<foreign>` formatting, homework review/fixes, Word file generation, build+push.
- **Language example formatting rollout** — Chapters 1-8 completed. Chapter 9 is next.
- **Homework difficulty calibration** — Chapters 8+ homework was flagged as too difficult. Ch8 assessed as appropriate (18 exercises, 5 parts, scaffolded progression). Continue monitoring for ch9+.

## Current Work
- Starting Chapter 9 improvement (Compound and Complex Sentences)
- For each chapter: diagram audit, `<foreign>` conversion, homework fixes, Word files, build+push

## Completed Chapters
- Chapters 1-6: `<foreign>` formatting only
- Chapter 7: Full structural overhaul (diagrams, MVP tables, step-by-step analysis, homework rewrite)
- Chapter 8: Full improvement (`<foreign>` conversion 213 instances, homework formatting fixes, Word files — committed 426b103)

## Next Steps
- Complete Chapter 9 improvement (current)
- Continue with Chapter 10 after Ch9

## Notes
- **Snapshot reminder:** Create `state-t20.md` at Task 20. No snapshots exist yet.
- **Pre-existing unstaged changes:** PNG diagram files (ch09-ch16) and regenerated homework .docx files (all chapters) remain unstaged. Only commit target chapter's files.
- **Ch8 unused NP diagrams:** 8 ch08_np_* PNGs exist but are not in the Diagram Examples section. Could add later.
