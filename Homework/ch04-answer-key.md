# Answer Key: Morphology and Word Structure

## Part 1: Morpheme Identification

**1.** *disagreements*

dis- (bound) + agree (free) + -ment (bound) + -s (bound) = 4 morphemes

**2.** *rebuilding*

re- (bound) + build (free) + -ing (bound) = 3 morphemes

**3.** *thoughtfulness*

thought (free) + -ful (bound) + -ness (bound) = 3 morphemes

**4.** *international*

inter- (bound) + nation (free) + -al (bound) = 3 morphemes

**5.** *unforgettable*

un- (bound) + forget (free) + -able (bound) = 3 morphemes

## Part 2: Applying the English Base Rule

**6.** *grandmother*

Number of morphemes: 2

*Grand* and *mother* are both words in modern English, so this is a compound: grand (free) + mother (free).

**7.** *describe*

Number of morphemes: 1

Although *describe* begins with *de-*, the remaining part *-scribe* is not a word in modern English. Therefore, *describe* is a single morpheme.

**8.** *replayable*

Number of morphemes: 3

re- (bound) + play (free) + -able (bound). *Play* is a word in modern English, so we can divide this word.

**9.** *subtract*

Number of morphemes: 1

Although *subtract* appears to contain *sub-* and *-tract*, *tract* is not a word in modern English (it's Latin for "pull" or "draw"). Therefore, *subtract* is a single morpheme.

**10.** *misplace*

Number of morphemes: 2

mis- (bound) + place (free). *Place* is a word in modern English, so we can divide this word.

Word with one suffix: *teacher*
- Morphemes: teach (free) + -er (bound)

Word with two suffixes: *teachers* or *teachable*
- Morphemes: teach (free) + -er (bound) + -s (bound)
- OR: teach (free) + -able (bound)

**12.** Base word: *kind*

Word with a prefix: *unkind*
- Morphemes: un- (bound) + kind (free)

Word with a prefix and a suffix: *unkindness* or *unkindly*
- Morphemes: un- (bound) + kind (free) + -ness (bound)
- OR: un- (bound) + kind (free) + -ly (bound)

**13.** Base word: *modern*

Word that is a verb: *modernize*
