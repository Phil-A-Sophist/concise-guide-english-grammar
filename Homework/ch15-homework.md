# ANSWER KEY

## Part 1: Comma Usage

**1.** *When the storm passed we surveyed the damage and began cleanup efforts.*

Corrected: *When the storm passed, we surveyed the damage and began cleanup efforts.*

Function(s): comma after introductory adverb clause. (Note: no comma before *and* because it joins two verbs, not two independent clauses.)

**2.** *She is talented hardworking and creative.*

Corrected: *She is talented, hardworking, and creative.*

Function(s): commas in a series (separating items in a list); the final comma is the Oxford comma.

**3.** *My brother who lives in Seattle is visiting next week.*

Corrected: *My brother, who lives in Seattle, is visiting next week.*

Function(s): commas setting off a nonrestrictive relative clause. (Assumes the speaker has only one brother; the clause adds extra information rather than identifying which brother.)

**4.** *The meeting was productive but it ran overtime.*

Corrected: *The meeting was productive, but it ran overtime.*

Function(s): comma before coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses (compound sentence).

**5.** *The tall distinguished professor gave an inspiring lecture.*

Corrected: *The tall, distinguished professor gave an inspiring lecture.*

Function(s): comma between coordinate adjectives. (Test: you can say "tall and distinguished professor," so a comma is needed.)

**6.** Explanation of why no comma is needed:

The clause *who completed the assignment* is restrictive (defining)—it specifies which students received extra credit (only those who completed the assignment, not all students). Restrictive clauses are not set off by commas because they are essential for identifying the noun.

---

## Part 2: Semicolons and Colons

**7.** *She had one goal ( : / ; ) to finish the project on time.*

Choice: colon

Reasoning: A colon introduces an explanation or elaboration after a complete sentence. The infinitive phrase explains what the "one goal" is.

**8.** *The rain stopped ( : / ; ) we went outside immediately.*

Choice: semicolon

Reasoning: A semicolon joins two closely related independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction.

**9.** *The committee includes three officers ( : / ; ) Dr. Lee, president; Ms. Park, secretary; and Mr. Kim, treasurer.*

Choice: colon

Reasoning: A colon introduces the list after a complete sentence. (Note: semicolons are used within the list because the items themselves contain commas.)

**10.** *He was exhausted ( : / ; ) however, he continued working.*

Choice: semicolon

Reasoning: A semicolon separates two independent clauses when the second begins with a conjunctive adverb (however). The semicolon comes before *however*, and a comma follows it.

---

## Part 3: Apostrophes

**11.** *Its important to understand its function in the sentence.*

Corrected: *It's important to understand its function in the sentence.*

Explanation: *It's* (contraction of "it is") in the first instance; *its* (possessive pronoun, no apostrophe) in the second.

**12.** *The students books were left in the classroom.*

Corrected: *The students' books were left in the classroom.*

Explanation: Plural possessive—the books belonging to the students.

**13.** *The Joneses car is parked in the driveway.*

Corrected: *The Joneses' car is parked in the driveway.*

Explanation: For plural proper nouns ending in -s, add just an apostrophe after the -s to show possession.

**14.** *Theyre going to their house over there.*

Corrected: *They're going to their house over there.*

Explanation: *They're* is a contraction of "they are."

**15.** *The womens team won the championship.*

Corrected: *The women's team won the championship.*

Explanation: *Women* is an irregular plural not ending in -s, so add *'s* for possession.

## Part 4: Comprehensive Punctuation

**16.** Punctuated: *When the meeting ended, the participants left quickly; however, several stayed behind to discuss the proposal. The main question was this: should they proceed?*

**17.** Punctuated: *The report, which took three months to complete, contained the following recommendations: reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase employee training. However, the board rejected all three proposals.*

**18.** Punctuated: *Dr. Smith, who has been teaching for twenty years, said, "I believe that students learn best when they're engaged in meaningful activities."*

## Part 5: Analysis and Application

### Meaning and Punctuation

**19.**

Explanation of (a) *The students who studied passed the exam.*: The clause "who studied" is restrictive—it identifies which students passed. This implies that only the students who studied passed; other students (who did not study) presumably did not pass.

Explanation of (b) *The students, who studied, passed the exam.*: The clause "who studied" is nonrestrictive—it adds extra information about all the students. This implies that all the students studied and all of them passed.

How punctuation changes meaning: The presence or absence of commas completely changes the meaning. Without commas (restrictive), only some students passed. With commas (nonrestrictive), all students passed.

### Real-World Application

**20.** Sample answer:

Paragraph: *The conference, which was held in Boston, attracted over 500 participants. Dr. Martinez gave the keynote speech; her topic was "Innovation in Education." She discussed three key areas: technology, pedagogy, and assessment. Attendees said, "This was the best conference we've attended."*

Punctuation mark 1: commas around *which was held in Boston*

Reason: Setting off a nonrestrictive relative clause that adds extra information about the conference.

Punctuation mark 2: semicolon after *speech*

Reason: Joining two closely related independent clauses.

Punctuation mark 3: colon after *areas*

Reason: Introducing a list after a complete sentence.

Punctuation mark 4: quotation marks around the attendees' words

Reason: Enclosing a direct quotation.

### Reflection

**21.** Answers will vary. Sample response:

a) The rule I find most confusing is distinguishing between restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses.

b) This rule is challenging because the decision depends on the meaning the writer intends, not just the grammar of the sentence. You have to think about context and what information is essential versus extra.

c) A strategy to master it: Ask myself, "If I remove this clause, does the sentence still identify what I'm talking about?" If yes, the clause is nonrestrictive (use commas). If no, it's restrictive (no commas). Also, reading the sentence aloud helps—if I naturally pause, commas are probably needed.
