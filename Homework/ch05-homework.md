# Homework: Open Classes

## Part 1: Word Class Identification (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each underlined word, identify its part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) using at least one morphological or syntactic test from the chapter. State which test you used.

### Example (completed):

**Word:** *carefully* in "She **carefully** reviewed the document."

Part of speech: Adverb

Test used: The -ly suffix test. "Carefully" is formed by adding -ly to the adjective "careful," which is a reliable pattern for adverbs. Additionally, it modifies the verb "reviewed," telling us how she reviewed.

## Part 2: Form vs. Function Analysis (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each sentence, identify the form (part of speech) and the function (grammatical role) of the underlined word. Remember the dual-identification principle: form is what the word IS; function is what the word DOES.

**Sentence:** *The **rich** often have different concerns.*

Word: *rich*

Form: Adjective (it can be graded: richer, richest; it can be modified by "very": very rich)

Function: Nominal (functioning as a noun—it follows the determiner "the," serves as the subject of the sentence, and refers to a group of people)

# ANSWER KEY

## Part 1: Word Class Identification

**1.** *development*

Part of speech: Noun

Test used: The noun suffix test. "Development" ends in -ment, a suffix that converts verbs to nouns (develop → development). Additionally, it follows the determiner "the" (the determiner test).

**2.** *quickly*

Part of speech: Adverb

Test used: The -ly suffix test. "Quickly" is formed by adding -ly to the adjective "quick." It also modifies the verb "solved," telling how she solved it.

**3.** *beautiful*

Part of speech: Adjective

Test used: The attributive position test. "Beautiful" appears between the determiner "the" and the noun "garden." It can also be graded (more beautiful, most beautiful) and modified by "very" (very beautiful).

**4.** *investigate*

Part of speech: Verb

Test used: The modal test. "Investigate" follows the modal "will" ("will investigate"). It can also be put into past tense (investigated) and take the -ing form (investigating).

**5.** *surprisingly*

Part of speech: Adverb

Test used: The -ly suffix test combined with the adjective modification test. "Surprisingly" is formed from the adjective "surprising" + -ly, and it modifies the adjective "confident" (not a verb), which is a characteristic adverb function.

## Part 5: Analysis and Reflection

**18.** Two examples where form and function differ:

Example 1:

Word: *elderly*
Form: Adjective (can be modified by "very," can appear in predicative position: "She is elderly")
Function: Nominal—functioning as a noun phrase, serving as the subject of the sentence after "the," referring to elderly people
Explanation: Although "elderly" is an adjective by form, it functions as a noun in this sentence, standing for "elderly people."

Example 2:

Word: *daily*
Form: Adjective (describing something that happens every day; a daily newspaper)
Function: Adjectival—modifying the noun "exercise" in the phrase "a daily exercise routine"
Note: This example shows form and function matching.

Better Example 2:

Word: *exercise* (in "daily exercise routine")
Form: Noun (can be pluralized: exercises; can follow determiners)
Function: Adjectival—functioning as a modifier of the noun "routine," telling what kind of routine
Explanation: "Exercise" is a noun by form but functions adjectivally here, modifying "routine."

**19.** Noun phrase analysis: *the government's new environmental policy*

Head: policy

Pre-modifiers:
- *the government's* — possessive determiner (specifies whose policy)
- *new* — adjective (describes the policy)
- *environmental* — adjective (describes the policy)

**20.** Reflection on form vs. function:

Sample answer: Understanding the distinction between form and function is essential because words in English are flexible—the same word can serve different grammatical roles in different contexts. For example, in the passage, "elderly" is an adjective by form (it can be graded and modified by "very"), but it functions nominally as the subject of the sentence. If we only identified "elderly" as an adjective, we would miss the fact that it's doing the work of a noun in this context. This dual-identification approach gives us a more complete and accurate picture of how language works, which helps both with analysis and with understanding how to construct effective sentences.
