## Section A: Multiple Choice (50 points)

### Section A1: Morphology and Word Structure (Questions 1–8, 16 points)

**Question 1:** How many morphemes does the word "disagreements" contain? (2 pts)

> **Answer: d**
>
> a. 1
>
> b. 2
>
> c. 3
>
> **d. 4** — *dis-* (bound) + *agree* (free) + *-ment* (bound) + *-s* (bound)

**Question 2:** Which of the following words contains exactly one morpheme? (2 pts)

> **Answer: b**
>
> a. unfriendly — 3 morphemes: *un-* + *friend* + *-ly*
>
> **b. describe** — 1 morpheme. Although it appears to begin with *de-*, the remaining *-scribe* does not combine with *de-* to produce the word's meaning compositionally. The word entered English as a unit.
>
> c. replayable — 3 morphemes: *re-* + *play* + *-able*
>
> d. misplace — 2 morphemes: *mis-* + *place*

**Question 3:** Which of the following is a bound morpheme? (2 pts)

> **Answer: c**
>
> a. book — free morpheme (can stand alone)
>
> b. happy — free morpheme (can stand alone)
>
> **c. -ness** — bound morpheme (cannot stand alone; must attach to another morpheme)
>
> d. walk — free morpheme (can stand alone)

**Question 4:** The suffix *-tion* typically creates which word class? (2 pts)

> **Answer: c**
>
> a. Verb
>
> b. Adjective
>
> **c. Noun** — *-tion* converts verbs into nouns: *action*, *creation*, *decision*
>
> d. Adverb

**Question 5:** Which word is an example of a compound (formed from two free morphemes)? (2 pts)

> **Answer: c**
>
> a. understand — 1 morpheme. The meaning of "understand" does not derive from "under" + "stand."
>
> b. carpet — 1 morpheme. "Car" + "pet" is coincidental resemblance, not a compound.
>
> **c. bookcase** — 2 free morphemes: *book* + *case*. The meaning is compositional (a case for books).
>
> d. receive — 1 morpheme. "Ceive" is not a word in modern English.

**Question 6:** The word "unhelpful" contains how many morphemes? (2 pts)

> **Answer: c**
>
> a. 1
>
> b. 2
>
> **c. 3** — *un-* (bound) + *help* (free) + *-ful* (bound)
>
> d. 4

**Question 7:** Which of the following correctly identifies the morphemes in "rebuilding"? (2 pts)

> **Answer: a**
>
> **a. *re-* (bound) + *build* (free) + *-ing* (bound)** — Correct. *Re-* is a bound prefix meaning "again," *build* is the free base, and *-ing* is a bound suffix.
>
> b. *re-* (free) + *build* (free) + *-ing* (bound) — Incorrect. *Re-* is bound, not free.
>
> c. *rebuild* (free) + *-ing* (bound) — Incorrect. *Rebuild* can be further divided into *re-* + *build*.
>
> d. *re-* (bound) + *building* (free) — Incorrect. *Building* should be divided into *build* + *-ing*.

**Question 8:** Which word best demonstrates the concept of morphological productivity — the active use of existing morpheme patterns to create new words? (2 pts)

> **Answer: b**
>
> a. receive — Borrowed as a whole word from Latin, not productively formed in English.
>
> **b. podcaster** — A recent creation using the productive *-er* suffix (meaning "one who") added to *podcast*. Demonstrates the same pattern as *teacher* and *writer*.
>
> c. understand — A single morpheme; no productive morphological process visible.
>
> d. carpet — A single morpheme; no productive morphological process visible.
