**Abbreviation Key**

| **Parts of Speech** | **Phrase Types** | **Roles** |

| Noun = N | Noun Phrase = NP | Subject = Subj |
| Verb = V | Verb Phrase = VP | Predicate = Pred |
| Adjective = ADJ | | |
| Adverb = ADV | Adjective Phrase = ADJP | |
| Determiner = DET | Adverb Phrase = ADVP | |
| Preposition = PREP | Prepositional Phrase = PP | |
| | Sentence = S | |

**Notes:**

1. In the Phrase row, label the main verb as **VP** (Verb Phrase). The VP label in the table applies to just the main verb itself.
2. In the Role row, label the subject noun phrase as **Subject** and the verb phrase as **Predicate**. Leave other role cells empty.
3. Always include a phrase level for nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions.
