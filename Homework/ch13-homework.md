### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *My sister, who lives in Portland, is visiting next week.*

- Type: Non-restrictive (NR)
- Reasoning: The commas indicate this adds extra information; the speaker has only one sister, so the clause doesn't identify which sister.

## Part 2: Restrictive vs. Non-Restrictive

**8.** *The students who completed the extra assignment received bonus points.*

Type: Restrictive (R)

Reasoning: No commas; the clause identifies which specific students received bonus points (only those who completed the extra assignment, not all students).

**9.** *The Eiffel Tower, which was built in 1889, attracts millions of visitors.*

Type: Non-restrictive (NR)

Reasoning: Commas present; the Eiffel Tower is already uniquely identified (there's only one), so the clause adds extra information rather than identifying which tower.

**10.** *The car that I bought last year already needs repairs.*

Type: Restrictive (R)

Reasoning: No commas; the clause identifies which specific car (the one bought last year, as opposed to other cars the speaker might have).

**11.** *My neighbor's dog, a golden retriever, barks every morning.*

Type: Non-restrictive (NR)

Reasoning: Commas present; this appositive phrase adds descriptive information about an already-identified dog (assuming the neighbor has only one dog).

## Part 5: Error Correction and Analysis

c) *Exhausted from the journey, the bed looked inviting.*

### Meaning Analysis

**22.**

Sentence (a) *My brother who lives in Chicago is a doctor.* implies: The speaker has more than one brother. The restrictive clause identifies which brother is being discussed (the one in Chicago, as opposed to other brothers who live elsewhere).

Sentence (b) *My brother, who lives in Chicago, is a doctor.* implies: The speaker has only one brother. The non-restrictive clause adds extra information about this already-identified brother.

### Multiple Adjectivals

**23.**

a) Adjectivals identified:

- *talented* - adjective (pre-modifier)
- *young* - adjective (pre-modifier)
- *American* - adjective/noun (pre-modifier, origin)
- *jazz* - noun (pre-modifier, type/purpose)
- *from New Orleans* - prepositional phrase (post-modifier)
- *who won the competition* - relative clause (post-modifier)

b) Typical order for pre-modifiers in English: Opinion/evaluation (talented) > Age (young) > Origin/nationality (American) > Type/purpose (jazz) > NOUN. This order reflects a principle where more subjective qualities come first and more objective, noun-like qualities come closer to the noun.

c) Post-modifiers follow the noun because they are longer, more complex structures (phrases and clauses). English has a tendency to place shorter, simpler elements before the noun and longer, more complex elements after. This creates a more balanced sentence structure and makes processing easier for readers/listeners.
