# Homework: Morphology and Word Structure

---

## Part 1: Morpheme Identification (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each word below, divide it into morphemes and classify each morpheme as free or bound. State the total number of morphemes.

You may present your analysis using any clear method, such as:
- Listing with labels (e.g., *un-* (bound) + *happy* (free) + *-ness* (bound) = 3 morphemes)
- A simple chart or table

Be sure your method clearly shows each morpheme and its classification.

### Example (completed):

**Word:** *unhappiness*

un- (bound) + happy (free) + -ness (bound) = 3 morphemes

**1.** *disagreements*

**2.** *rebuilding*

**3.** *thoughtfulness*

**4.** *international*

**5.** *unforgettable*

## Part 2: Applying the English Base Rule (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each word, determine whether it contains one morpheme or multiple morphemes. Apply the English base rule: *a word can only be divided into morphemes if the base is a word in modern English.*

### Example (completed):

**Word:** *contain*

Number of morphemes: 1

Although *contain* appears to begin with *con-*, the remaining part *-tain* is not a word in modern English. Therefore, *contain* is a single morpheme.

## Part 3: Word Building (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Using the base words provided, create new words by adding affixes. Write the complete word and identify all morphemes.

### Example (completed):

**Base word:** *hope*

Word with one suffix: *hopeful*
- Morphemes: hope (free) + -ful (bound)

Word with a prefix and suffix: *unhopeful*
- Morphemes: un- (bound) + hope (free) + -ful (bound)

Morphemes:

Create a word with two suffixes:

Morphemes:

**12.** Base word: *kind*

Create a word with a prefix:

## Part 4: Morpheme Identification in Context (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Read the passage below. Identify five words that contain multiple morphemes and list the morphemes for each.

### Passage:

*The researchers carefully analyzed the unprecedented developments in artificial intelligence. Their findings suggested that technological modernization would dramatically reshape workplaces worldwide. The implications were unmistakable.*

### Example (completed):

**Word:** *researchers*

Morphemes: research (free) + -er (bound) + -s (bound)

## Part 5: Analysis and Reflection (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions, explaining your reasoning.

**15.** Complex words are built up step by step, with each morpheme attaching in a specific order. Track the formation of the word *unprecedented* by identifying the base and then showing the order in which morphemes attach.

### Example (completed):

**Word:** *unhappiness*

Formation:
1. happy (base—adjective)
2. unhappy (un- + happy—adjective meaning "not happy")
3. unhappiness (unhappy + -ness—noun meaning "the state of being unhappy")

**Word:** *unprecedented*

Formation:

# ANSWER KEY

## Part 1: Morpheme Identification

**1.** *disagreements*

dis- (bound) + agree (free) + -ment (bound) + -s (bound) = 4 morphemes

**2.** *rebuilding*

re- (bound) + build (free) + -ing (bound) = 3 morphemes

**3.** *thoughtfulness*

thought (free) + -ful (bound) + -ness (bound) = 3 morphemes

**4.** *international*

inter- (bound) + nation (free) + -al (bound) = 3 morphemes

**5.** *unforgettable*

un- (bound) + forget (free) + -able (bound) = 3 morphemes

---

## Part 2: Applying the English Base Rule

**6.** *grandmother*

Number of morphemes: 2

*Grand* and *mother* are both words in modern English, so this is a compound: grand (free) + mother (free).

**7.** *describe*

Number of morphemes: 1

Although *describe* begins with *de-*, the remaining part *-scribe* is not a word in modern English. Therefore, *describe* is a single morpheme.

**8.** *replayable*

Number of morphemes: 3

re- (bound) + play (free) + -able (bound). *Play* is a word in modern English, so we can divide this word.

**9.** *subtract*

Number of morphemes: 1

Although *subtract* appears to contain *sub-* and *-tract*, *tract* is not a word in modern English (it's Latin for "pull" or "draw"). Therefore, *subtract* is a single morpheme.

**10.** *misplace*

Number of morphemes: 2

mis- (bound) + place (free). *Place* is a word in modern English, so we can divide this word.

## Part 3: Word Building

**11.** Base word: *teach*

Word with one suffix: *teacher*
- Morphemes: teach (free) + -er (bound)

Word with two suffixes: *teachers* or *teachable*
- Morphemes: teach (free) + -er (bound) + -s (bound)
- OR: teach (free) + -able (bound)

**12.** Base word: *kind*

Word with a prefix: *unkind*
- Morphemes: un- (bound) + kind (free)

Word with a prefix and a suffix: *unkindness* or *unkindly*
- Morphemes: un- (bound) + kind (free) + -ness (bound)
- OR: un- (bound) + kind (free) + -ly (bound)

**13.** Base word: *modern*

Word that is a verb: *modernize*
- Morphemes: modern (free) + -ize (bound)

Word that is a noun: *modernity* or *modernization*
- Morphemes: modern (free) + -ity (bound)
- OR: modern (free) + -ize (bound) + -ation (bound)
