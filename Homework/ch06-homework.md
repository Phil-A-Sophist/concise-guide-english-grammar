## Part 5: Analysis and Reflection

**14.** Four prepositional phrases from the passage:

PP 1:
Phrase: *in the laboratory*
Type: Adjectival (or possibly adverbial)
Modifies: "researcher" (or "examined")
Question answered: Which researcher? (or Where did examining occur?)

PP 2:
Phrase: *with a powerful microscope*
Type: Adverbial
Modifies: "examined"
Question answered: How? / With what instrument?

PP 3:
Phrase: *of the results*
Type: Adjectival
Modifies: "analysis"
Question answered: Analysis of what?

PP 4:
Phrase: *in the department*
Type: Adjectival
Modifies: "everyone"
Question answered: Which everyone? / Everyone where?

Other acceptable PPs from the passage:
- *in a major journal* (adverbial—where published)
- *about the process* (adjectival—modifies "assumptions")

**15.** Ambiguity of *in the laboratory*:

Adjectival interpretation: The phrase modifies "researcher," specifying which researcher—the one who works in the laboratory. It answers "which researcher?"

Adverbial interpretation: The phrase modifies "examined," specifying where the examining took place—in the laboratory. It answers "where did she examine the sample?"

How to determine the intended reading: Context usually clarifies. If the point is to identify which researcher (distinguishing her from researchers elsewhere), the adjectival reading applies. If the point is to describe where the action occurred, the adverbial reading applies. The test of movement can help: adverbial PPs can often move to sentence-initial position (*In the laboratory, the researcher examined...*), while adjectival PPs typically cannot move without changing meaning. In this sentence, both readings are plausible, but the adverbial reading (describing where the examination took place) seems more natural given the focus on the action.

**16.** Relative pronoun analysis:

Relative pronoun: *that*

Antecedent: *findings* (the noun phrase "The findings")

Grammatical role within the relative clause: *that* functions as the direct object of "published" within the relative clause. The clause structure is "[that] she published [that] in a major journal"—she published the findings.

**17.** Reflection on closed-class words:

Sample answer: Closed-class words may carry less content meaning than open-class words, but they provide the essential grammatical structure that holds sentences together. Determiners specify which entities we're discussing (the difference between "a book" and "the book" changes the entire reference). Pronouns allow us to refer back to entities without awkward repetition. Prepositions show relationships between elements—spatial, temporal, and logical. If we removed these words, sentences would become telegraphic and ambiguous: "Student library studied midnight" conveys far less than "The student in the library studied until midnight." Closed-class words are the glue of grammar.
