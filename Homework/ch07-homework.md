## Part 2: Heads and Modifiers (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each phrase, identify the head and list all modifiers. Classify each modifier by type (determiner, adjective, adverb, prepositional phrase, etc.).

### Example (completed):

**Phrase:** *the very tall young basketball player from Chicago*

Head: *player*

Modifiers:
- *the* — determiner
- *very tall* — adjective phrase (containing adverb "very" + adjective "tall")
- *young* — adjective
- *basketball* — noun (functioning adjectivally)
- *from Chicago* — prepositional phrase

## Part 3: Sentence Writing (approx. 5 minutes)

**Instructions:** Write original sentences following each prompt.

---

**7.** Write a sentence following the basic S → NP + VP structure with a complex subject NP containing at least a determiner, an adjective, and a prepositional phrase:

**8.** Write a sentence that is structurally ambiguous (has two possible meanings due to different possible structures). Then explain both meanings.

Sentence:

Meaning 1:

Meaning 2:

**9.** Expand the simple sentence below by adding modifiers to both the subject NP and the predicate VP:

Original: *Dogs bark.*

Your expanded version:

## Part 4: Tree Diagram Analysis (approx. 10 minutes)

**Instructions:** For each sentence, draw a tree diagram showing its hierarchical structure. Label all nodes (S, NP, VP, PP, Det, N, V, Adj, Adv, Prep, etc.). You may draw by hand and photograph, use a digital tool, or describe the structure in bracket notation.

### Example (completed):

**Sentence:** *The cat slept.*

Tree diagram (bracket notation): [S [NP [Det the] [N cat]] [VP [V slept]]]

Or as a visual tree:
```
       S
     /   \
   NP     VP
  /  \     |
Det   N    V
 |    |    |
the  cat  slept
```

## Part 5: Structural Ambiguity Analysis

**13.** *I saw the man with the telescope*

a) Two possible meanings:

Meaning 1: I used a telescope to see the man. (The telescope was the instrument of seeing.)

Meaning 2: I saw a man who had/was holding a telescope. (The man possessed the telescope.)

b) PP attachment:

Attachment for Meaning 1: The PP "with the telescope" attaches to the VP—it modifies the verb "saw," functioning adverbially to describe HOW or WITH WHAT I saw.

Attachment for Meaning 2: The PP "with the telescope" attaches to the NP "the man"—it modifies the noun, functioning adjectivally to describe WHICH man.

c) Tree structure for Meaning 1 (adverbial PP attachment):

```
         S
       /   \
     NP     VP
      |   __|__|___
      I  V    NP   PP
         |    |    |
        saw the man with the telescope
```

Tree structure for Meaning 2 (adjectival PP attachment):

```
         S
       /   \
     NP     VP
      |    /  \
      I   V   NP
          |  _|___
         saw |    |
          the man PP
                  |
           with the telescope
```

**14.** *Old men and women attended the meeting*

a) Two possible meanings:

Meaning 1: Old men AND women (of any age) attended. Only the men are described as old.

Meaning 2: Old men AND old women attended. Both groups are old.

b) Structural difference:

The ambiguity arises from how "old" and the coordination "men and women" are grouped:

- In Meaning 1, "old" modifies only "men," and then "old men" is coordinated with "women": [[old men] and [women]]

- In Meaning 2, "old" modifies the entire coordinated NP "men and women": [old [men and women]]

This is a case of scope ambiguity—does the adjective have narrow scope (modifying just "men") or wide scope (modifying the entire conjunction)?

**15.** Reflection on hierarchical structure:

Sample answer: Understanding hierarchical sentence structure matters because meaning depends not just on which words appear, but on how those words are grouped together. Tree diagrams make these groupings explicit. For reading comprehension, recognizing structure helps us correctly interpret ambiguous sentences—for instance, knowing whether "with the telescope" describes the man or describes how I saw him completely changes the meaning. For writing, awareness of structure helps us avoid unintended ambiguity and construct clearer sentences. If I write "I saw the man with the telescope" and mean that I used a telescope, I might revise to "Using a telescope, I saw the man" to eliminate the alternative reading. Hierarchical structure is the invisible architecture that organizes meaning.
