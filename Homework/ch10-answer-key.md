## Part 5: Contextual Analysis

**19.** Tense-aspect identification:

- *moved*: past simple
- *has lived*: present perfect
- *visited*: past simple
- *was working*: past progressive
- *has been writing*: present perfect progressive
- *will have finished*: future perfect
- *will be looking*: future progressive

**20.** The writer uses *moved* (past simple) because the act of moving is a completed, one-time past event. The writer uses *has lived* (present perfect) because the situation of living in Boston began in the past and continues to the present. The present perfect connects the past to the present moment.

**21.** Rewrites and meaning changes:

a) Past progressive: *She was studying linguistics.*
- Meaning change: Indicates she was in the middle of studying at a specific past time; suggests ongoing action that may no longer be happening.

b) Present perfect: *She has studied linguistics.*
- Meaning change: Indicates she has completed some study of linguistics at some point up to now; suggests experience or relevance to the present.

c) Future perfect: *She will have studied linguistics.*
- Meaning change: Indicates that by a future reference point, her study of linguistics will be completed.
