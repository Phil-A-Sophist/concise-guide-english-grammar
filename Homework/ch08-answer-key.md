# Answer Key: Basic Sentence Elements and Sentence Patterns

## Part 1: Sentence Element Identification

**1.** *The ambitious young researcher from the university laboratory discovered a remarkable solution.*

Subject NP: *The ambitious young researcher from the university laboratory*

Predicate: *discovered a remarkable solution*

Main verb: *discovered*

Direct object: *a remarkable solution*

**2.** Complements in each sentence:

a) *The committee awarded the outstanding student a prestigious scholarship.*

- Indirect object (IO): *the outstanding student*
- Direct object (DO): *a prestigious scholarship*

b) *The homemade soup tasted absolutely delicious.*

- Subject complement (SC): *absolutely delicious* (adjective phrase describing the subject "soup")

c) *The judges declared the young contestant the winner.*

- Direct object (DO): *the young contestant*
- Object complement (OC): *the winner* (identifies the DO—the contestant = the winner)

**3.** Argument or adverbial:

a) *She placed the documents **on the desk**.*

**Argument** — required by the verb "place." You cannot say *~~She placed the documents.~~* The verb "place" requires both a direct object (what) and a location (where).

b) *She found the documents **on the desk**.*

**Adverbial** — optional. The sentence "She found the documents" is grammatically complete. "On the desk" provides additional information about where.

c) *The professor is **extremely knowledgeable about linguistics**.*

**Argument** — the subject complement is required after the verb "is." Without it (*~~The professor is.~~*), the sentence is incomplete.

d) *The professor lectured **extremely knowledgeably about linguistics**.*

**Adverbial** — optional modifiers. "The professor lectured" is a complete sentence. "Extremely knowledgeably" and "about linguistics" provide additional information but are not required.

## Part 3: Sentence Pattern Identification

**8.** *The exhausted marathon runner collapsed at the finish line yesterday.*

Pattern: Pattern 1 (Intransitive)

Explanation: The main verb is "collapsed." "At the finish line" and "yesterday" are adverbials (where and when—both optional). The core sentence is "The exhausted marathon runner collapsed." The verb "collapse" is intransitive—it does not take an object or require a complement. The subject simply performs the action.

**9.** *My grandmother's secret recipe remains a family treasure.*

Pattern: Pattern 3 (Linking verb)

Explanation: The main verb is "remains," which is a linking verb. "A family treasure" is a subject complement (NP) that identifies the subject "recipe." The *be* substitution test confirms this: "My grandmother's secret recipe is a family treasure" makes sense. The complement describes/identifies the subject rather than receiving an action.

**10.** *The committee considered the proposal inadequate.*

Pattern: Pattern 6 (S + V + DO + OC)

Explanation: The main verb is "considered." "The proposal" is the direct object, and "inadequate" is an object complement (adjective) describing the DO. The OC and DO refer to the same thing: the proposal is described as inadequate. This is not Pattern 5 because "inadequate" describes "proposal" rather than being a separate entity.

**11.** *The chef prepared the guests an extraordinary seven-course meal.*

Pattern: Pattern 5 (S + V + IO + DO)

Explanation: The main verb is "prepared." "The guests" is the indirect object (recipient—for whom was it prepared?) and "an extraordinary seven-course meal" is the direct object (what was prepared?). The IO and DO refer to different things (guests ≠ meal). This can be rephrased with "for": "prepared an extraordinary meal for the guests."

**12.** *The situation grew increasingly tense during the negotiations.*

Pattern: Pattern 3 (Linking verb)

Explanation: The main verb is "grew," functioning as a linking verb here (meaning "became"). "Increasingly tense" is a subject complement describing the subject "situation." "During the negotiations" is an adverbial (when—optional). The *be* substitution test: "The situation was increasingly tense" preserves the meaning, confirming "grew" is linking.

## Part 4: Sentence Writing

**13.** Pattern 4 (transitive: S + V + DO):

Example: ***The researchers** (S) **analyzed** (V) **the experimental data** (DO).*

Other acceptable examples:
- The artist painted a beautiful landscape.
- My sister reads mystery novels.

**14.** Pattern 5 (ditransitive: S + V + IO + DO):

Example: ***The professor** (S) **taught** (V) **her students** (IO) **an important lesson** (DO).*

Other acceptable examples:
- The company offered employees a bonus.
- My friend sent me a postcard.

**15.** Pattern 6 (ditransitive: S + V + DO + OC):

Example: ***The news** (S) **made** (V) **everyone** (DO) **nervous** (OC).*

Other acceptable examples:
- The committee named her president.
- The critics called the performance brilliant.
- We found the solution inadequate.

## Part 5: Analysis and Reflection

**16.** Analysis of *put*:

a) *She put the book on the shelf.*

What happens if you remove "the book"?
*~~She put on the shelf.~~* — Ungrammatical. The sentence requires a direct object.

What happens if you remove "on the shelf"?
*~~She put the book.~~* — Ungrammatical or incomplete. The verb "put" requires a location.

What does this tell you about the valency of *put*?
The verb "put" has a valency of 3—it requires three arguments: a subject (who puts), a direct object (what is put), and a locative complement (where it is put). Unlike most transitive verbs, "put" cannot function with just a subject and object; the location is also obligatory. This makes "on the shelf" an argument, not an adverbial.

**17.** Linking vs. transitive verbs:

a) *The milk smells sour.* vs. *The detective smells trouble.*

Which is linking? "The milk smells sour" — linking verb

Which is transitive? "The detective smells trouble" — transitive verb

How can you tell? Apply the *be* substitution test:
- "The milk **is** sour" — Makes sense. The adjective "sour" describes the milk. Therefore, "smells" is linking.
- "The detective **is** trouble" — Does not preserve the meaning. "Trouble" is not a description of the detective; it's something the detective perceives/detects. Therefore, "smells" is transitive, with "trouble" as its direct object.

**18.** Reflection on arguments vs. adverbials:

Sample answer: Arguments are elements required by the verb to form a grammatical and complete sentence, while adverbials are optional modifiers that add information about time, place, manner, or reason. To distinguish them, I use the removal test: if removing an element makes the sentence ungrammatical or fundamentally incomplete, it's an argument; if the sentence remains grammatical, it's an adverbial. This distinction matters because sentence patterns are defined by required elements, not optional ones. For example, "She put the book on the shelf" and "She read the book on the shelf" look similar, but "on the shelf" is an argument with "put" (required) and an adverbial with "read" (optional). Recognizing this difference is essential for correctly identifying patterns and understanding verb valency.
