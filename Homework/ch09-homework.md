# ANSWER KEY

## Part 1: Sentence Type Identification

**1.** *The professor who taught my linguistics class has retired, but she still occasionally gives guest lectures.*

Sentence type: Compound-complex

Clauses:
- *The professor who taught my linguistics class has retired* — IC (contains embedded DC)
- *who taught my linguistics class* — DC (relative clause modifying "professor")
- *she still occasionally gives guest lectures* — IC

**2.** *Because the deadline was extended, I had time to revise my paper thoroughly.*

Sentence type: Complex

Clauses:
- *Because the deadline was extended* — DC (adverb clause showing reason)

**3.** *The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya and her experienced coach celebrated after the race.*

Sentence type: Simple

Clauses:
- One IC only: *The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya and her experienced coach celebrated after the race*
- Note: "and" connects compound subjects (runner and coach), not two independent clauses. "After the race" is a prepositional phrase, not a dependent clause.

**4.** Dependent clause identification:

a) *The candidate who impressed the committee received the position.*

Dependent clause: *who impressed the committee*
Type: Relative clause (adjective clause) — modifies "candidate"

b) *I wonder whether she received my message.*

Dependent clause: *whether she received my message*

## Part 2: Sentence Completion

**5.** Add coordinating conjunction:

*The evidence was compelling**, yet/but** the jury remained skeptical.*

(Either "yet" or "but" works to show contrast)

***When/Once/After/If** you finish your assignment, you may leave early.*

(Multiple conjunctions work; "when" and "if" are most natural)

*The experiment produced unexpected results**; therefore,/; consequently,/; thus,** the team decided to repeat it.*

(Note: semicolon before, comma after the conjunctive adverb)

**8.** Add dependent clause:

## Part 5: Analysis and Reflection

**16.** Coordination vs. subordination:

Original: *The experiment failed, and the researchers were disappointed.*

a) Subordination emphasizing disappointment:
*When the experiment failed, the researchers were disappointed.*
OR: *The researchers were disappointed because the experiment failed.*

(The main clause focuses on the disappointment; the failure is background information in the dependent clause.)

b) Subordination emphasizing the failure:
*The experiment failed, which disappointed the researchers.*
OR: *Although the researchers were disappointed, the experiment failed.* (awkward—demonstrates that this emphasis is harder to achieve through subordination)

Better: *The experiment that the researchers had worked on for months failed.* (embeds disappointment implication)

c) Which version for equal importance?
Coordination (the original) is best for presenting both ideas as equally important. When we coordinate two independent clauses with "and," we signal that neither idea is subordinate to the other—both receive equal grammatical weight. Subordination, by contrast, places one idea in a dependent clause, signaling that it provides background or supporting information for the main clause.

**17.** Passage analysis:

*When the storm began, the hikers sought shelter. They found a small cave, and they waited there for hours. Although they were cold and hungry, they remained calm because they had prepared for emergencies.*

a) Independent and dependent clauses:

Independent clauses:
1. *the hikers sought shelter*
2. *They found a small cave*
3. *they waited there for hours*
4. *they remained calm*

Dependent clauses:
1. *When the storm began* — adverb clause (time)
2. *Although they were cold and hungry* — adverb clause (contrast/concession)
3. *because they had prepared for emergencies* — adverb clause (reason)

b) Number and type of sentences:

Three sentences:
1. *When the storm began, the hikers sought shelter.* — Complex (1 IC + 1 DC)
2. *They found a small cave, and they waited there for hours.* — Compound (2 ICs)
3. *Although they were cold and hungry, they remained calm because they had prepared for emergencies.* — Complex (1 IC + 2 DCs)

**18.** Reflection on coordination vs. subordination:

Sample answer: Writers should choose coordination when they want to present ideas as equally important or when showing a simple additive, contrastive, or sequential relationship. Coordination treats both ideas as having equal weight: "The sun rose, and the birds began to sing" presents these as parallel events. Subordination, on the other hand, is appropriate when one idea should be emphasized over another or when showing causal, temporal, or conditional relationships. In "When the sun rose, the birds began to sing," the main clause (birds singing) receives emphasis while the dependent clause provides context. The choice affects how readers interpret the relative importance of ideas—subordination guides readers toward what matters most, while coordination lets readers weigh both ideas equally.
