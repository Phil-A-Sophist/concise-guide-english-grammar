## Part 5: Analysis and Application

**19.** Five adverbials from the passage:

Adverbial 1: *Yesterday*

Form: NP

Semantic role: time

Adverbial 2: *finally*

Form: AdvP

Semantic role: time

Adverbial 3: *Surprisingly*

Form: AdvP

Semantic role: attitude (disjunct)

Adverbial 4: *diligently*

Form: AdvP

Semantic role: manner

Adverbial 5: *for three years*

Form: PP

Semantic role: time (duration)

Other acceptable answers: *because funding was severely limited* (adverb clause, reason), *Nevertheless* (AdvP, conjunct), *in a prestigious journal* (PP, place), *last month* (NP, time), *If additional funding becomes available* (adverb clause, condition), *next year* (NP, time), *in a new laboratory* (PP, place)

**20.** Explanation of disjunct vs. adjunct:

*Surprisingly* is a disjunct because it expresses the speaker's attitude toward the entire proposition (the speaker finds the results surprising). It is not part of the clause content and cannot be focused, questioned, or negated ("*Did surprisingly the results contradict...?" is ungrammatical).

*Diligently* is an adjunct because it modifies the verb directly, telling how they worked. It is part of the proposition and can be questioned and negated ("Did they work diligently?" / "They didn't work diligently").

**21.** Repositioning *yesterday*:

Position 1: *Yesterday, the researchers finally completed their groundbreaking study.* (original)

Effect: Initial position sets the temporal frame for the sentence; the time is established first as a topic marker.

Position 2: *The researchers finally completed their groundbreaking study yesterday.*

Effect: Final position is the default/neutral position for time adverbials; slight emphasis on *yesterday* as new information.

Position 3: *The researchers yesterday finally completed their groundbreaking study.*

Effect: Medial position is unusual for this adverbial and creates some emphasis on *yesterday* by placing it in an unexpected position.
