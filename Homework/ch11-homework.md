## Part 5: Analysis and Application

**23.** Passive constructions and reasons:

Passive construction 1: *was announced*

Reason: Focuses on the announcement itself rather than who made it; maintains "new policy" as topic.

Passive construction 2: *will be made*

Reason: The decision is more important than who makes it; keeps focus on the decision process.

Passive construction 3: *have been reviewed*

Reason: Focuses on the responses being reviewed rather than who reviews them; agent is obvious (management) so doesn't need stating.

**24.** Modals in the passage:

Modal 1: *must* (in "must submit")

Type: deontic (obligation)

Modal 2: *should* (in "should improve")

Type: epistemic (expectation/prediction)

Modal 3: *might* (in "might create")

Type: epistemic (possibility)

**25.** Analysis of *The manager rejected the proposal*:

a) Passive version: *The proposal was rejected by the manager.*

b) Passive more appropriate: When writing a report focused on what happened to the proposal, when trying to maintain topic continuity (if the proposal was the topic of previous sentences), or when trying to soften the message by not emphasizing who made the negative decision.

c) Active preferred: When you want to clearly assign responsibility, when the manager is the main topic, or when you want direct, clear communication that doesn't obscure who made the decision.
