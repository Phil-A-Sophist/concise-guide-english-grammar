# Homework Format Guide

This document establishes the standard formats for homework answer keys and classroom overhead files, modeled on the Chapter 5 files.

# Answer Keys

## General Structure

Each answer key follows this layout:

```
# Chapter X: [Chapter Title] - Answer Key

---

## X.Y.1 [Section Title]

**Instructions:** [Brief restatement of what the exercise asks students to do.]

---

**1. [Question prompt or sentence]**

[Answer content]

---

**2. [Next question]**

...
```

### Key formatting rules:

- **Title:** `# Chapter X: [Title] - Answer Key`
- **Section headings:** `## X.Y.Z [Section Title]` matching the homework section numbering
- **Instructions:** Bold label followed by a brief description, one per section
- **Question numbers:** Bold, matching the exercise numbers from the homework
- **Horizontal rules** (`---`) separate each question for visual clarity

---

## Answer Formatting

### Labeled fields

Each answer uses **bold labels** on their own line:

```
**Part of speech:** Noun

**Headword:** carefully

**Phrase type:** Adverb Phrase (AdvP)

**Sample sentence:** "The crew will clean the stadium after the game."
```

### Multi-point explanations use bullet lists

When an answer involves multiple tests, reasons, or observations, use **bullets** rather than packing them into a single paragraph. Each bullet gets a **bold label** identifying the type of point:

```
**Tests used:**

- **Morphological test:** The suffix -ment typically derives nouns from verbs.
- **Syntactic test:** "development" follows the determiner "The" and functions as the subject.
- **Pronoun replacement:** It can be replaced by a pronoun: "It takes time."
```

### Short explanations stay as single lines

When an explanation is brief and covers only one point, use italic text on its own line:

```
*Explanation:* "Carefully" is an adverb, and "very" intensifies it.
```

### Open-ended / variable answers

For questions where multiple correct answers exist, provide a sample and note the range of acceptable responses:

```
**Sample revised sentence:** "The committee reviewed several important documents."

*Other acceptable answers include any grammatical NP as direct object.*
```

### Reflection questions

For open-ended reflection questions, use:

```
*Answers will vary. Sample responses:*
```

Then format sub-questions with bold letter labels (`**a.** ...`, `**b.** ...`). Use bullets for lists within a reflection answer.

## Checklist for New Answer Keys

1. Title and section headings match the homework numbering
2. Every question is numbered and bold
3. Each section has an **Instructions** line
4. Multi-point explanations use bullets with bold labels (not paragraphs)
5. Horizontal rules separate individual questions
6. Sample answers for open-ended questions are clearly marked as samples
7. Formatting is consistent with the Chapter 5 Answer Key

# Overhead Files (Classroom Projection)

Overhead files are reformatted versions of the answer keys designed for projecting in class. The layout lets the instructor show the question first, then scroll down to reveal the answer.

## Naming Convention

Files are named `Homework XX Overhead.docx` (e.g., `Homework 05 Overhead.docx`).

## Page Layout

Each homework question occupies its own page with this structure:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Question at top of page     │
│                              │
│                              │
│    ~270pt vertical gap       │
│                              │
│                              │
│  Answer begins mid-page      │
│  - bullet point              │
│  - bullet point              │
│  - bullet point              │
│                              │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

- Each question (Heading 2) and sub-question (Heading 3) starts on a **new page**
- Section headings (Heading 1) also start new pages, with the first question of that section appearing on the same page
- A **270pt space-after** on the question heading pushes the answer to roughly halfway down the page

## Font Sizes

All text must meet a **22pt minimum** for readability on a projector:

| Element | Style | Size |
|---------|-------|------|
| Section titles | Heading 1 | 28pt |
| Questions | Heading 2 | 26pt |
| Sub-questions | Heading 3 | 24pt |
| Answer text, bullets, labels | Body Text / First Paragraph / Compact | 22pt |
| Table content | — | 22pt |

## Content Style

Overhead files use **condensed** versions of the full answer key:

- Shorter labels (e.g., "Tests:" instead of "Tests used:")
- Briefer bullet points (key fact only, no full sentences)
- Bullet lists for all multi-point answers
- Sample answers clearly labeled

## Checklist for New Overhead Files

1. Every question starts on its own page (page break before each Heading 2/3)
2. All fonts are 22pt minimum
3. 270pt gap after each question heading
4. Section headings (Heading 1) share a page with the first question of that section
5. Content is condensed from the full answer key for quick classroom review
