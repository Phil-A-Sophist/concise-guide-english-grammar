## Part 5: Analysis and Application

### Gerund vs. Infinitive

**23.** Analysis of *stop*:

Grammatical difference: In (a), *smoking* is a gerund (direct object of *stop*). In (b), *to smoke* is an infinitive phrase (adverbial of purpose).

Meaning difference: (a) *She stopped smoking* means she quit the habit of smoking. (b) *She stopped to smoke* means she paused what she was doing in order to smoke (purpose).

**24.** Analysis of *remember*:

Meaning difference: (a) *I remember locking the door* means I have a memory of the past action of locking the door (I recall doing it). (b) *I remember to lock the door* means I don't forget to lock the door; I remember that I should/need to do it (prospective).

### Transformation and Style

**25.** Transformations of *The experiment succeeded*:

a) That-clause as subject: *That the experiment succeeded pleased the researchers.*

b) Gerund phrase as subject: *The experiment's succeeding pleased the researchers.* OR *The experiment succeeding pleased the researchers.*

c) Wh-clause as direct object: *We wondered whether the experiment had succeeded.* OR *They asked how the experiment had succeeded.*

d) Infinitive phrase after *seem*: *The experiment seemed to succeed.* OR *The experiment seems to have succeeded.*

**26.** Extraposition analysis:

a) What is extraposition? Extraposition is moving a clausal subject to the end of the sentence and inserting *It* as a placeholder subject. For example, *That she won surprised us* becomes *It surprised us that she won.*

b) Writer might prefer extraposed version when: The subject clause is long and would make the sentence front-heavy; the writer wants to create suspense by delaying the key information; the focus should be on the reaction or matrix predicate rather than the clause content; it sounds more natural in speech and informal writing.

c) Writer might prefer non-extraposed version when: The clause subject is relatively short; the writer wants to emphasize the clause content by putting it first; in formal or academic writing where topic prominence is important; when maintaining parallel structure with other sentences that have clausal subjects.
