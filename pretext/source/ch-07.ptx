    <title>Why Diagram Sentences?</title>

    <p>When you read a sentence like <q><foreign>The exhausted hiker from Colorado finally reached the summit</foreign></q>, you process it instantly. Your brain parses the words, groups them into meaningful units, and extracts the meaning—all in a fraction of a second, without conscious effort.</p>

    <p>But can you explain <em>how</em> you understand it? Which words group together? What modifies what? Why does <q><foreign>from Colorado</foreign></q> describe <q><foreign>hiker</foreign></q> rather than <q><foreign>exhausted</foreign></q>? Why does <q><foreign>finally</foreign></q> modify <q><foreign>reached</foreign></q> and not <q><foreign>summit</foreign></q>?</p>

    <p><em>Sentence diagrams</em> make visible what your brain does automatically. They transform the linear string of words on the page into a picture of grammatical relationships.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Analytical Clarity</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Diagrams force you to make explicit decisions about every word's function. You cannot diagram a sentence without understanding it. If you are uncertain whether <q><foreign>in the park</foreign></q> modifies <q><foreign>the man</foreign></q> or <q><foreign>saw</foreign></q>, the diagram demands a choice—and making that choice reveals your interpretation.</p>

    <p>This explicitness is valuable for writing as well as analysis. When a sentence seems unclear or awkward, diagramming it can expose the structural problem.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Pattern Recognition</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>After diagramming many sentences, you will begin to recognize structural patterns instantly—even in sentences you have never seen before. You will notice that English sentences, despite their surface variety, follow a small number of fundamental patterns. This recognition transfers to reading and writing.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>A Shared Vocabulary</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Diagrams provide a shared vocabulary for discussing sentence structure. Instead of saying &quot;that part,&quot; you can point to a specific node or branch. Instead of vague intuitions about what &quot;sounds right,&quot; you can make precise claims about structural relationships.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Revealing Hidden Structure</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Most importantly, diagrams reveal that sentences have <em>hierarchical structure</em>—structure that is not obvious from the linear sequence of words. Consider:</p>

    <p><q><foreign>Flying planes can be dangerous.</foreign></q></p>

    <p>This sentence is ambiguous. It could mean:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>The activity of flying planes is dangerous.</p></li>
      <li><p>Planes that are flying can be dangerous.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The words are the same in both readings, but the structure differs. A diagram makes this structural difference visible—two different diagrams for two different meanings.</p>

    <title>The Basic Structure of English Sentences</title>

    <p>Every English sentence—from the simplest to the most complex—shares a fundamental structure.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>S → NP + VP</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>At its core, every sentence (S) divides into two parts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>A <em>noun phrase (NP)</em> functioning as the subject</p></li>
      <li><p>A <em>verb phrase (VP)</em> functioning as the predicate</p></li>
    </ul>

    <image source="diagrams/new/ch07_snpvp_abstract.png" width="25%">
      <description>Abstract syntax tree showing S branching into NP (subject) and VP (predicate)</description>
    </image>
    <p><c>[S [NP] [VP]]</c></p>

    <p>The subject NP tells us <em>who or what</em> the sentence is about. The predicate VP tells us <em>what the subject does, is, or experiences</em>.</p>

    <p>Consider these sentences:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Sentence</cell>
        <cell>Subject NP</cell>
        <cell>Predicate VP</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><foreign>Dogs bark.</foreign></cell>
        <cell><foreign>Dogs</foreign></cell>
        <cell><foreign>bark</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><foreign>The old man sat quietly.</foreign></cell>
        <cell><foreign>The old man</foreign></cell>
        <cell><foreign>sat quietly</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><foreign>My brilliant sister from Ohio won the prize.</foreign></cell>
        <cell><foreign>My brilliant sister from Ohio</foreign></cell>
        <cell><foreign>won the prize</foreign></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>No matter how complex the sentence becomes, this basic division remains. The subject can grow elaborate (<foreign>The extremely talented young musician from the small town in rural Pennsylvania who had never performed professionally before...</foreign>) and the predicate can become equally elaborate (<foreign>...suddenly found herself standing on the stage of Carnegie Hall</foreign>). But the fundamental structure—subject NP plus predicate VP—persists.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>What's in the NP?</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A noun phrase is built around a noun (its head). The simplest NP is just a noun or pronoun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Dogs</em> bark.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>She</em> arrived.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>But NPs can include additional elements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Determiners: <foreign><em>the</em> dog</foreign>, <foreign><em>my</em> sister</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Adjectives: <foreign>the <em>old</em> dog</foreign>, <foreign>my <em>brilliant</em> sister</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Prepositional phrases: <foreign>the dog <em>on the porch</em></foreign>, <foreign>my sister <em>from Ohio</em></foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Relative clauses: <foreign>the dog <em>that barked</em></foreign>, <foreign>my sister <em>who lives in Ohio</em></foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of these elements cluster around the head noun, forming a unit—the noun phrase.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>What's in the VP?</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A verb phrase is built around a verb (its head). The simplest VP is just a verb:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>Dogs <em>bark</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>She <em>arrived</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>But VPs typically include additional elements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Objects: <foreign>She <em>read the book</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Complements: <foreign>He <em>is a doctor</em>.</foreign> <foreign>She <em>became famous</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Adverbials: <foreign>She <em>arrived yesterday</em>.</foreign> <foreign>He <em>spoke loudly</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The verb phrase contains everything in the predicate—the verb itself plus whatever follows it.</p>

    <title>Tree Diagrams: Reading and Interpreting</title>

    <p>This textbook uses <em>tree diagrams</em> (also called phrase structure trees or constituent trees) to represent sentence structure. Tree diagrams show how words group into phrases and phrases group into larger structures.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Components of a Tree</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Nodes</em>: Points in the tree, labeled with category symbols (S, NP, VP, N, V, etc.). Each node represents either a word or a phrase.</p>

    <p><em>Branches</em>: Lines connecting nodes, showing which elements belong together. Elements connected to the same higher node form a unit.</p>

    <p><em>Dominance</em>: A node dominates everything beneath it. The S node at the top dominates the entire sentence. An NP node dominates everything in that noun phrase.</p>

      <title>Reading a Simple Tree</title>

    <p><em>Example</em>: <q><foreign>The dog barked.</foreign></q></p>

      <description>Syntax tree for "The dog barked" showing NP with DET and N, and VP with V</description>
    </image>
    <p><c>[S [NP [DET The] [N dog]] [VP [V barked]]]</c></p>

    <p>Reading from the top:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>The S (sentence) divides into NP and VP</p></li>
      <li><p>The NP contains DET (determiner) + N (noun): <q><foreign>the dog</foreign></q></p></li>
      <li><p>The VP contains just V (verb): <q><foreign>barked</foreign></q></p></li>
      <li><p>The words themselves appear at the bottom</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The tree shows that <q><foreign>the</foreign></q> and <q><foreign>dog</foreign></q> form a unit (the NP), and this unit is the subject of the verb <q><foreign>barked</foreign></q>.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>A More Complex Example</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Example</em>: <q><foreign>The young artist from Paris painted beautiful landscapes.</foreign></q></p>

    <image source="diagrams/new/ch07_artist_painted.png" width="70%">
      <description>Syntax tree for "The young artist from Paris painted beautiful landscapes" showing complex NP with PP modifier and VP with object NP</description>

    <p>This tree shows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The subject NP contains: DET + ADJP + N + PP</p></li>
      <li><p>The PP <q><foreign>from Paris</foreign></q> is <em>inside</em> the subject NP—it modifies <q><foreign>artist</foreign></q></p></li>
      <li><p>The VP contains: V + object NP</p></li>
      <li><p>The object NP contains: ADJP + N</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why Trees Show Hierarchy</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Notice that the tree is not just a flat list of words. It shows <em>grouping</em>. <q><foreign>The young artist from Paris</foreign></q> is a unit; <q><foreign>beautiful landscapes</foreign></q> is a unit. These units can be moved, replaced, and manipulated as wholes.</p>

    <p>For instance, you can replace the entire subject NP with a pronoun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>The young artist from Paris</em> painted...</foreign> → <foreign><em>She</em> painted...</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can move the entire object NP to the front for emphasis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>Beautiful landscapes, the young artist from Paris painted.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These operations work on <em>constituents</em>—groups that the tree identifies as units.</p>

  <section xml:id="ch-07-introduction-to-sentence-diagramming-sec-74">
    <title>Heads, Modifiers, and Complements</title>

    <p>Every phrase is organized around a <em>head</em>—the central, obligatory element that determines the phrase's category and core meaning. Other elements are either <em>modifiers</em> (optional elements that add information) or <em>complements</em> (elements that complete the head's meaning).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Heads</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The head is the word that the phrase is &quot;about.&quot; It determines:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Category: A phrase headed by a noun is a noun phrase; a phrase headed by a verb is a verb phrase</p></li>
      <li><p>Core meaning: The head provides the basic meaning; other elements elaborate on it</p></li>
      <li><p>Grammatical requirements: The head determines what complements are needed</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the noun phrase <q><foreign>the tall man</foreign></q>, the head is <q><foreign>man</foreign></q>. Without <q><foreign>man</foreign></q>, you don't have a noun phrase.</p>

    <p>In the verb phrase <q><foreign>carefully read the instructions</foreign></q>, the head is <q><foreign>read</foreign></q>. It determines the phrase's category and requires an object.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Modifiers</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Modifiers</em> are optional elements that add information about the head. They can be removed without making the phrase ungrammatical.</p>

    <p><em>In noun phrases:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Adjectives: <foreign>the tall man</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Prepositional phrases: <foreign>the man in the hat</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Relative clauses: <foreign>the man who arrived late</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>In verb phrases:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Adverbs: <foreign>she spoke quietly</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Prepositional phrases: <foreign>she works at a hospital</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Modifiers answer questions like &quot;which one?&quot; &quot;what kind?&quot; &quot;how?&quot; &quot;when?&quot; &quot;where?&quot;</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Objects and Complements</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some elements in a phrase do more than modify the head—they <em>complete</em> it. These fall into two categories: <em>objects</em> and <em>complements</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Objects</em> are noun phrases in the verb phrase that receive the action or are directly affected by the verb. Transitive verbs require an object to form a complete thought:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She read <em>the book</em>.</foreign> (direct object—what she read)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>The cat chased <em>the mouse</em>.</foreign> (direct object—what it chased)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Complements</em> in the broader sense are elements that complete the meaning of a linking verb by describing or renaming the subject:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>He is <em>a doctor</em>.</foreign> (subject complement—a noun phrase renaming the subject)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>She became <em>famous</em>.</foreign> (subject complement—an adjective phrase describing the subject)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>More complex complement patterns (such as verbs that take two objects) will be covered in Chapter 8.</p>

    <p>The key difference between objects/complements and modifiers is <em>obligatoriness</em>: if removing an element makes the sentence feel incomplete, it is likely an object or complement rather than a modifier.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She read the book carefully.</foreign> → <foreign>She read the book.</foreign> (OK—<q><foreign>carefully</foreign></q> is a modifier)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>She read the book carefully.</foreign> → <foreign>She read carefully.</foreign> (Changed meaning—<q><foreign>the book</foreign></q> is an object)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>How Structure Determines Meaning</title>

    <p>One of the most important lessons of syntax is that <em>meaning depends on structure</em>, not just on the words themselves. The same words in different structures produce different meanings.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Structural Ambiguity</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When a sentence has two possible structures, it is <em>structurally ambiguous</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Example</em>: <q><foreign>I saw the man with binoculars.</foreign></q></p>

    <p>This sentence has two readings:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>I used binoculars to see the man. (PP modifies VP)</p></li>
      <li><p>I saw the man who had binoculars. (PP modifies NP)</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>A student encountering this sentence for the first time might instinctively begin diagramming by attaching <q><foreign>with binoculars</foreign></q> to the VP—after all, it seems natural to read it as describing the act of seeing. But look at what happens when we consider the alternative structure, where <q><foreign>with binoculars</foreign></q> attaches to the NP <q><foreign>the man</foreign></q> instead. The two trees below make the structural difference visible.</p>

    <p><em>Structure 1</em> (PP attaches to VP—<q><foreign>with binoculars</foreign></q> describes how I saw):</p>

    <image source="diagrams/new/ch07_binoculars_vp.png" width="60%">
      <description>Syntax tree showing "with binoculars" as PP attached to VP, meaning I used binoculars to see the man</description>
    </image>
    <p><c>[S [NP [PRON I]] [VP [V saw] [NP [DET the] [N man]] [PP [PREP with] [NP [N binoculars]]]]]</c></p>

    <p><em>Structure 2</em> (PP attaches to NP—<q><foreign>with binoculars</foreign></q> describes which man):</p>

    <image source="diagrams/new/ch07_binoculars_np.png" width="60%">
      <description>Syntax tree showing "with binoculars" as PP attached to NP "the man", meaning the man had binoculars</description>
    </image>
    <p><c>[S [NP [PRON I]] [VP [V saw] [NP [DET the] [N man] [PP [PREP with] [NP [N binoculars]]]]]]</c></p>

    <p>The diagrams make the ambiguity explicit. In Structure 1, the PP <q><foreign>with binoculars</foreign></q> is a daughter of VP—it modifies the verb <q><foreign>saw</foreign></q>, telling us <em>how</em> I saw. In Structure 2, the PP is a daughter of the object NP—it modifies <q><foreign>the man</foreign></q>, telling us <em>which</em> man I saw. The words are identical, but the tree structures are different, and so are the meanings.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>More Examples of Structural Ambiguity</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Example</em>: <q><foreign>Flying planes can be dangerous.</foreign></q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Reading 1: The activity of flying planes is dangerous.</p></li>
      <li><p>Reading 2: Planes that are flying can be dangerous.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Example</em>: <q><foreign>Old men and women gathered.</foreign></q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Reading 1: Old men, and women (of any age)</p></li>
      <li><p>Reading 2: Old people of both genders</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In each case, the ambiguity arises from structural options—different ways of grouping the words.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why This Matters</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Understanding structural ambiguity matters for several reasons:</p>

    <p><em>For reading</em>: Recognizing that a sentence has multiple possible structures helps you interpret texts accurately.</p>

    <p><em>For writing</em>: Awareness of structural ambiguity helps you avoid writing sentences that could be misread. If a sentence has an unintended reading, restructure it.</p>

    <p><em>For analysis</em>: Structural ambiguity demonstrates that meaning is not just in the words—it's in how the words are organized.</p>

    <title>Sentence Labeling Tables</title>

    <p>Tree diagrams reveal the full hierarchical structure of a sentence, but they are not the only analytical tool available. <em>Sentence labeling tables</em> provide a complementary approach: they arrange the words of a sentence in columns and label each word's part of speech, the phrase it belongs to, and its grammatical role. Labeling tables are imperfect—they cannot always capture the full range of connections and hierarchy the way a tree diagram can. However, they can be a useful tool to aid you in building diagrams or to capture additional information about sentences, for instance by identifying roles played by various elements of the sentence. Throughout this textbook, we will provide pre-made tables that help to guide you toward your analysis.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Table Format</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A sentence labeling table has four rows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>Role</em> (top row): The grammatical function of a word or group of words in the sentence.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Phrase</em>: The phrase type that the word belongs to (NP, MVP, PP, ADJP, ADVP).</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Word</em>: The actual words of the sentence, one per column.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Part of Speech</em> (bottom row): The word-level category (N, V, DET, ADJ, ADV, PREP, etc.).</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each column represents one word. When a role or phrase spans multiple words, the label appears in the first column of that group, and the remaining columns in the group are left empty.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Introducing Roles and the MVP</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>For now, we introduce only two roles: <em>Subject</em> and <em>Predicate</em>. The Subject is the NP daughter of S—the noun phrase that tells us who or what the sentence is about. The Predicate is the verb phrase that tells us what the subject does or is.</p>

    <p>In the Phrase row, we use a special label for the predicate: <em>MVP</em> (Main Verb Phrase). The MVP consists of only the main verb (and, in later chapters, any auxiliaries or modals). It does <em>not</em> include objects, complements, or adverbials—even though the full VP in a tree diagram does. Think of the MVP as the core of the predicate.</p>

    <p>Later chapters will introduce additional roles such as Direct Object, Indirect Object, Subject Complement, and Adverbial.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>How to Complete a Table</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When you are given a sentence labeling table, work from the bottom up:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>Step 1—Part of Speech</em>: Identify the part of speech for each word (N, V, DET, ADJ, ADV, PREP, etc.).</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Step 2—Phrase</em>: Group words into phrases and label each phrase type (NP, MVP, PP, ADJP, ADVP).</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Step 3—Role</em>: Assign grammatical roles to the phrases (Subject, Predicate).</p></li>
    </ol>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Example 1: "The dog barked."</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Let us walk through this simple intransitive sentence.</p>

    <p><em>Step 1—Part of Speech</em>: <q><foreign>The</foreign></q> is a DET, <q><foreign>dog</foreign></q> is a N, <q><foreign>barked</foreign></q> is a V.</p>

    <p><em>Step 2—Phrase</em>: <q><foreign>The dog</foreign></q> forms an NP. <q><foreign>Barked</foreign></q> is the MVP.</p>

    <p><em>Step 3—Role</em>: The NP <q><foreign>The dog</foreign></q> is the Subject. The MVP <q><foreign>barked</foreign></q> is the Predicate.</p>

    <p>The completed table:</p>

    <tabular halign="center">
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Role</cell>
        <cell>Subject</cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell>Predicate</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Phrase</cell>
        <cell>NP</cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell>MVP</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Word</cell>
        <cell>The</cell>
        <cell>dog</cell>
        <cell>barked</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>POS</cell>
        <cell>DET</cell>
        <cell>N</cell>
        <cell>V</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>Compare this with the tree diagram for the same sentence:</p>

    <image source="diagrams/new/ch07_dog_barked.png" width="35%">
      <description>Syntax tree for "The dog barked"</description>
    </image>
    <p><c>[S [NP [DET The] [N dog]] [VP [V barked]]]</c></p>

    <p>Notice that the tree shows <q><foreign>The</foreign></q> and <q><foreign>dog</foreign></q> are both <em>inside</em> the NP—the tree captures this containment relationship visually. The table lists them as separate columns sharing the NP label, but it cannot show the hierarchical nesting the way the tree does.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Example 2: "The cat chased the mouse."</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Now let us try a transitive sentence.</p>

    <p><em>Step 1—Part of Speech</em>: <q><foreign>The</foreign></q> is a DET, <q><foreign>cat</foreign></q> is a N, <q><foreign>chased</foreign></q> is a V, <q><foreign>the</foreign></q> is a DET, <q><foreign>mouse</foreign></q> is a N.</p>

    <p><em>Step 2—Phrase</em>: <q><foreign>The cat</foreign></q> forms an NP. <q><foreign>Chased</foreign></q> is the MVP. <q><foreign>The mouse</foreign></q> forms another NP.</p>

    <p><em>Step 3—Role</em>: The NP <q><foreign>The cat</foreign></q> is the Subject. The MVP <q><foreign>chased</foreign></q> is the Predicate. But what about <q><foreign>the mouse</foreign></q>? It is a noun phrase that receives the action—it is the <em>object</em> of the verb. However, we have not yet introduced the Direct Object role in our table system, so we leave the Role cell empty for now. The words still receive their POS and Phrase labels.</p>

    <tabular halign="center">
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Role</cell>
        <cell>Subject</cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell>Predicate</cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Phrase</cell>
        <cell>NP</cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell>MVP</cell>
        <cell>NP</cell>
        <cell></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Word</cell>
        <cell>The</cell>
        <cell>cat</cell>
        <cell>chased</cell>
        <cell>the</cell>
        <cell>mouse</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>POS</cell>
        <cell>DET</cell>
        <cell>N</cell>
        <cell>V</cell>
        <cell>DET</cell>
        <cell>N</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>And the corresponding tree:</p>

    <image source="diagrams/new/ch07_cat_chased.png" width="50%">
      <description>Syntax tree for "The cat chased the mouse"</description>
    </image>
    <p><c>[S [NP [DET The] [N cat]] [VP [V chased] [NP [DET the] [N mouse]]]]</c></p>

    <p>The tree makes clear what the table cannot easily show: the object NP <q><foreign>the mouse</foreign></q> is <em>inside</em> the VP, dominated by the VP node. In the table, <q><foreign>the mouse</foreign></q> simply appears as a separate NP to the right of the MVP—the containment relationship is invisible.</p>

      <title>Tables and Trees Together</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Tables and trees are complementary tools. Tables excel at quickly cataloging parts of speech, phrases, and roles in a linear format. Trees excel at showing hierarchical structure—which phrases contain other phrases, and how elements relate to each other structurally. For full analysis, use both: the table to identify the pieces and the tree to show how they fit together.</p>

    <title>Step-by-Step Sentence Analysis</title>

    <p>When you encounter a sentence to analyze, there are two complementary approaches: <em>top-down</em> and <em>bottom-up</em>. Both arrive at the same tree, but they start from different ends. Learning both gives you flexibility—you can choose whichever feels more natural for a given sentence, or combine elements of both.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="ch-07-analysis-top-down">
      <title>Top-Down Analysis</title>

      <p>In a top-down analysis, you start with the whole sentence and progressively divide it into smaller units.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p><em>Step 1—Divide S into NP + VP</em>: Identify where the subject ends and the predicate begins. The subject NP is the &quot;who or what&quot; of the sentence. Everything else is the VP.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 2—Find the head noun and head verb</em>: In the subject NP, identify the head noun—the central noun the phrase is built around. In the VP, identify the head verb.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 3—Identify additional elements</em>: Look at the remaining words. Are they modifiers (DET, ADJ, ADV, PP) that add information about the head? Are they objects that complete the verb? Determine which node each element attaches to.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 4—Draw the tree</em>: Starting from S at the top, draw branches for each division you identified. Label every node.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 5—Complete the sentence table</em>: Fill in POS, Phrase, and Role for each word.</p></li>

        <title>Worked Example: "The old man sat quietly."</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p><em>Step 1—Divide S into NP + VP</em>: The subject is <q><foreign>The old man</foreign></q> (who sat?). The predicate is <q><foreign>sat quietly</foreign></q> (what did the man do?).</p>

      <p><em>Step 2—Find the heads</em>: The head noun of the NP is <q><foreign>man</foreign></q>. The head verb of the VP is <q><foreign>sat</foreign></q>.</p>

      <p><em>Step 3—Identify additional elements</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>In the NP: <q><foreign>The</foreign></q> is a DET modifying <q><foreign>man</foreign></q>. <q><foreign>Old</foreign></q> is an ADJ inside an ADJP, also modifying <q><foreign>man</foreign></q>.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the VP: <q><foreign>Quietly</foreign></q> is an ADV inside an ADVP, modifying the verb <q><foreign>sat</foreign></q>.</p></li>

      <title>Bottom-Up Analysis</title>

      <p>In a bottom-up analysis, you start with the individual words and build upward toward the full sentence.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><p><em>Step 1—Label each word's POS</em>: Go through the sentence word by word and assign a part of speech to each (N, V, DET, ADJ, ADV, PREP, PRON, etc.).</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 2—Group words into phrases</em>: Look for clusters of words that form units. A DET + N forms an NP. An ADV alone can be an ADVP. A PREP + NP forms a PP.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 3—Identify phrase relationships</em>: Determine which phrases are parts of larger phrases. Does an ADJP modify a noun inside an NP? Does an ADVP modify a verb inside the VP? Does an NP serve as the object inside a VP?</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Step 4—Build up to S</em>: Combine the subject NP and the VP under a single S node.</p></li>

      <p><em>Step 2—Group words into phrases</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><q><foreign>The cat</foreign></q> → NP (DET + N)</p></li>

      </ul>

      <p><em>Step 3—Identify phrase relationships</em>: The V <q><foreign>chased</foreign></q> takes the NP <q><foreign>the mouse</foreign></q> as its object, so together they form the VP: <q><foreign>chased the mouse</foreign></q>.</p>

      <title>Which Approach Should You Use?</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Top-down analysis works well when you can quickly identify the subject and predicate—the big picture is clear, and you work inward to the details. Bottom-up analysis works well when the structure is less obvious or when you want to be systematic—you start with what you know for certain (individual words) and build from there.</p>

    <p>Most experienced analysts use a blend of both approaches. They may start top-down by splitting S into NP and VP, then switch to bottom-up within the NP to identify modifiers and their arrangement. The important thing is not which approach you use, but that you arrive at a consistent, well-formed tree that accounts for every word in the sentence.</p>

        <title>Instructions</title>
      </paragraphs>
      <p>The sentences below are structurally ambiguous—they can be understood in more than one way because of how their parts can be grouped. For each sentence, create tree diagrams to show the different possible structures and explain why the ambiguity arises.</p>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Exercises</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p><em>Exercise 13.</em> The comedian Groucho Marx once joked: <foreign>I shot an elephant in my pajamas.</foreign></p>

      <p>a) Describe the two possible meanings of this sentence:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Meaning 1: _____</p></li>
        <li><p>Meaning 2: _____</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>b) Draw a tree diagram for each reading. Pay close attention to where the PP <q><foreign>in my pajamas</foreign></q> attaches—does it attach to the VP or to the NP <q><foreign>an elephant</foreign></q>?</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Tree for Meaning 1: _____</p></li>
        <li><p>Tree for Meaning 2: _____</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>c) In a paragraph, explain why this sentence is funny. What structural ambiguity makes the joke work? Which reading does the audience expect, and which reading does Groucho intend?</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Your response: _____</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Exercise 14.</em> Read the following sentence carefully: <foreign>The horse raced past the barn fell.</foreign></p>

      <p>This is called a <em>garden-path sentence</em>—a sentence that leads the reader down one structural path before revealing that a different structure was intended. (Hint: try reading it as <q><foreign>The horse <em>that was</em> raced past the barn fell.</foreign></q>)</p>

      <p>a) Describe the initial reading that most people attempt when they first encounter this sentence. Why does it seem to "break" at the word <q><foreign>fell</foreign></q>?</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Your response: _____</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>b) Now describe the correct reading of the sentence. What role does <q><foreign>raced past the barn</foreign></q> play in the sentence?</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Your response: _____</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>c) In a paragraph, explain why garden-path sentences cause confusion. What does this tell us about how our brains process sentence structure in real time?</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Your response: _____</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Exercise 15.</em> In 3-4 sentences, explain why understanding hierarchical sentence structure (as shown in tree diagrams) matters for both reading comprehension and clear writing. Use a specific example to support your explanation.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Your response: _____</p></li>
