    <title>The Purpose of Punctuation</title>

    <p>Punctuation marks are visual signals that clarify meaning and guide readers through text. They indicate pauses, separate elements, and show relationships between parts of sentences.</p>

    <p>Good punctuation makes prose easier to read and prevents misunderstanding:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Let's eat grandma.</em> (disturbing)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Let's eat, grandma.</em> (dinner invitation)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Terminal Punctuation</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Period (.)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Ends declarative sentences and mild imperatives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The meeting is at noon.</p></li>
      <li><p>Please close the door.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Question Mark (?)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Ends direct questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What time is it?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you finished?</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Note</em>: Indirect questions take periods:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>She asked what time it was.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Exclamation Point (!)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Indicates strong emotion or emphasis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Watch out!</p></li>
      <li><p>What a surprise!</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use sparingly in formal writing.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-15-punctuation-sec-153">
    <title>The Comma</title>

    <p>The comma is the most frequently used—and misused—punctuation mark.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Comma in Compound Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Place a comma before a coordinating conjunction joining independent clauses:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"The sun set, <em>and</em> the stars appeared."</p></li>
      <li><p>"She tried hard, <em>but</em> she didn't succeed."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Comma After Introductory Elements</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Use a comma after introductory phrases or clauses:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>After the meeting, we went to lunch.</p></li>
      <li><p>However, I disagree.</p></li>
      <li><p>Running quickly, she caught the bus.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Commas with Nonrestrictive Elements</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Set off nonrestrictive (non-essential) modifiers with commas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"My sister, <em>who lives in Boston</em>, is visiting."</p></li>
      <li><p>"The report, <em>which I submitted yesterday</em>, was approved."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Do not</em> use commas with restrictive (essential) modifiers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>The students who studied passed.</em> (no commas—specifies which students)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Commas in Series</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Separate items in a list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>She bought apples, oranges, and bananas.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The comma before <em>and</em> (the Oxford comma) is optional but recommended for clarity:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>I admire my parents, Gandhi, and Mother Teresa.</em> (clear)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>I admire my parents, Gandhi and Mother Teresa.</em> (ambiguous)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Commas with Coordinate Adjectives</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Separate adjectives that independently modify the noun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>a tall, elegant woman</em> (tall and elegant both modify woman)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Test</em>: If you can put <em>and</em> between them, use a comma.</p>

    <p><em>Don't</em> use commas between cumulative adjectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>a big red barn</em> (not ~~big, red barn~~—big red modifies barn together)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Comma Misuse</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Comma splice</em>: Using only a comma between independent clauses:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>~~The rain stopped, we went outside.~~</p></li>
      <li><p>Correct: <em>The rain stopped, and we went outside.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Separating subject from verb</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>~~The man who arrived late, was my cousin.~~</p></li>
      <li><p>Correct: <em>The man who arrived late was my cousin.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>The Semicolon</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Between Independent Clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Joins related independent clauses without a conjunction:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The rain stopped; we went outside.</p></li>
      <li><p>She's talented; however, she lacks experience.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>In Complex Series</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Separates items in a series when items contain commas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The committee includes Dr. Smith, president; Mr. Jones, treasurer; and Ms. Lee, secretary.</p></li>

    <p><em>Don't</em> use a colon after an incomplete sentence:</p>

    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>In Formal Contexts</title>
