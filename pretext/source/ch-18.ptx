    <title>Sources of Unclear Writing</title>

    <p>Unclear writing often results from grammatical problems that create confusion about meaning. Understanding these problems helps you write—and revise—more effectively.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-18-clarity-and-readability-sec-182">
    <title>Pronoun Reference</title>

    <p>Pronouns must clearly refer to identifiable antecedents.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Ambiguous Reference</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When a pronoun could refer to more than one noun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~John told Mark that <em>he</em> was promoted.~~</em> (Who was promoted?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>John told Mark, &quot;I was promoted.&quot;</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: "John congratulated Mark on <em>Mark's</em> promotion."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Vague Reference</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When the pronoun has no clear antecedent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~<em>They</em> say it will rain.~~</em> (Who are &quot;they&quot;?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>Weather forecasters predict rain.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~<em>It</em> says in the article that...~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>The article states that...</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Broad Reference</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When this, that, which, or <em>it</em> refers to a whole clause rather than a specific noun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~She arrived late, which upset everyone.~~</em> (What does &quot;which&quot; refer to?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>Her late arrival upset everyone.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Tip</em>: After writing <em>this</em> or <em>which</em>, ask: &quot;This/which <em>what</em>?&quot;</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-18-clarity-and-readability-sec-183">
    <title>Modifier Placement</title>

    <p>Modifiers should be placed close to what they modify.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Misplaced Modifiers</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A modifier in the wrong position can create confusion or unintended meanings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~She almost drove <em>her car</em> into every pothole.~~</em> (Did she almost drive, or almost every pothole?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: "She drove her car into <em>almost every</em> pothole."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~I only eat <em>vegetables</em>.~~</em> (Only I eat them? I do nothing but eat them?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: "I eat <em>only vegetables</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Squinting Modifiers</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A modifier positioned ambiguously between two elements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~Students who study <em>often</em> succeed.~~</em> (Do they study often, or often succeed?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: "Students who <em>often study</em> succeed."</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: "Students who study succeed <em>often</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Dangling Modifiers</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A modifier that doesn't logically connect to any element in the sentence:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~<em>Walking down the street</em>, the trees were beautiful.~~</em> (Trees weren't walking)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em><em>Walking down the street</em>, I noticed the beautiful trees.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~<em>To improve results</em>, the experiment was redesigned.~~</em> (Experiment didn't improve results)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em><em>To improve results</em>, researchers redesigned the experiment.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>The fix</em>: Ensure the modifier's implied subject matches the sentence's actual subject.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-18-clarity-and-readability-sec-184">
    <title>Structural Ambiguity</title>

    <p>Some sentences are grammatically correct but structurally ambiguous.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>PP Attachment</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>I saw the man with binoculars.</em> (Who had the binoculars?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>Using binoculars, I saw the man.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>I saw the man who had binoculars.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Coordination Scope</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Old men and women gathered.</em> (Are the women old too?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>Old men and old women gathered.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>Women and old men gathered.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Relative Clause Attachment</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>The senator's daughter who was at the party left early.</em> (Was the senator or the daughter at the party?)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>The senator's daughter, who was at the party, left early.</em> (daughter at party)</p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>The daughter of the senator who was at the party left early.</em> (senator at party)</p></li>
    </ul>

  <section xml:id="ch-18-clarity-and-readability-sec-185">
    <title>Sentence Complexity</title>

    <p>Overly complex sentences impair readability.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Sentence Length</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Very long sentences strain working memory. When sentences exceed 25-30 words, consider dividing them:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>~~The committee, which was established by the board last year to investigate the issues raised by employees concerning workplace conditions, submitted its final report, which contained numerous recommendations for improvement, yesterday.~~</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>The committee submitted its final report yesterday. The board had established the committee last year to investigate employee concerns about workplace conditions. The report contained numerous recommendations for improvement.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Nested Structures</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Multiple embeddings create difficulty:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>~~The book that the professor who teaches the course that I'm taking recommended was unavailable.~~</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>I'm taking a course. The professor who teaches it recommended a book, but the book was unavailable.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Right Level of Complexity</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some complexity is necessary for sophisticated ideas. The goal isn't simplistic prose but appropriate complexity—complex enough for your content, simple enough for your audience.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-18-clarity-and-readability-sec-186">
    <title>Parallel Structure</title>

    <p>Coordinated elements should be grammatically parallel.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Faulty Parallelism</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~She likes <em>swimming</em>, <em>hiking</em>, and <em>to ride bikes</em>.~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>She likes <em>swimming</em>, <em>hiking</em>, and <em>biking</em>.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~The proposal is <em>interesting</em>, <em>innovative</em>, and <em>has potential</em>.~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>The proposal is <em>interesting</em>, <em>innovative</em>, and <em>promising</em>.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>With Correlative Conjunctions</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Parallelism is especially important with correlative conjunctions (both...and, either...or, not only...but also):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~She <em>not only</em> plays piano <em>but also</em> she sings.~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em>She <em>not only</em> plays piano <em>but also</em> sings.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~<em>Either</em> you leave now <em>or</em> staying late.~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Clear: <em><em>Either</em> you leave now <em>or</em> you stay late.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-18-clarity-and-readability-sec-187">
    <title>Word Choice for Clarity</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Precision</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Choose words that say exactly what you mean:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Vague: "The results were <em>interesting</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>Precise: <em>The results were <em>surprising</em> / <em>encouraging</em> / <em>contradictory</em>.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Avoiding Jargon</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Technical terms are appropriate for technical audiences. For general audiences, use plain language:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Jargon: <em>The initiative was <em>impacted</em> by <em>bandwidth</em> constraints.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Plain: <em>The project was delayed because staff were too busy.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Concrete vs. Abstract</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Concrete language is clearer than abstract language:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Abstract: <em>Improvements were made in the area of employee satisfaction.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Concrete: <em>More employees reported being satisfied with their jobs.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>14.</em></p>

    <p><em>Walking into the meeting, the tension was immediately apparent. The manager told the employees that they needed to improve. This led to frustration.
