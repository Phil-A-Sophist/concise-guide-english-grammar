    <title>Parts of Speech</title>

    <p>Most students first learn about parts of speech through definitions based on meaning. You've probably heard these:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>A noun names a person, place, thing, or idea.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>A verb is an action word.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>An adjective describes a noun.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>An adverb modifies a verb.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These <em>semantic</em> definitions—definitions based on meaning—are helpful starting points. They work well for many common words: <em>teacher</em> names a person (noun), <em>run</em> expresses an action (verb), <em>tall</em> describes a quality (adjective), <em>quickly</em> tells how an action is performed (adverb).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Limits of Semantic Definitions</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>But semantic definitions run into trouble surprisingly often. Consider these challenges:</p>

    <p><em>Is "destruction" a thing?</em> The word <em>destruction</em> is clearly a noun—it follows <em>the</em> (<em>the destruction</em>), it can be plural (<em>destructions</em>), and it has a noun suffix (<em>-tion</em>). Yet it doesn't name a "thing" in any concrete sense. It names an action or event. Similarly, <em>arrival</em>, <em>swimming</em>, <em>development</em>, and <em>happiness</em> are all nouns, but none names a "person, place, or thing."</p>

    <p><em>Is "know" an action?</em> The verb <em>know</em> doesn't describe anything we actively do—it describes a mental state. So do <em>believe</em>, <em>own</em>, <em>resemble</em>, and <em>deserve</em>. These are verbs, but calling them "action words" stretches the definition uncomfortably.</p>

    <p><em>Where do function words fit?</em> What "thing" does <em>the</em> name? What action does <em>is</em> perform? Words like <em>the</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>of</em>, and <em>very</em> play grammatical roles that semantic definitions cannot easily capture.</p>

    <p>The fundamental problem is that semantic definitions work backward: they assume we already know what the word means and then try to fit that meaning into a category. But meaning is slippery, and the same word can mean different things in different contexts.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>A Better Approach: Form and Function</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>In this course, we'll use two more reliable methods for identifying parts of speech:</p>

    <p><em>Morphological tests</em> examine what <em>forms</em> a word can take—what endings or inflections it accepts. Nouns can be plural and possessive. Verbs can take past tense and <em>-ing</em>. Adjectives can be compared. These patterns are consistent regardless of meaning.</p>

    <p><em>Syntactic tests</em> examine how a word <em>functions</em> in sentences—where it can appear and what other words can accompany it. Nouns follow determiners like <em>the</em>. Verbs follow modals like <em>can</em>. Adjectives appear between <em>the</em> and a noun.</p>

    <p>Together, these tests give us objective criteria for classification. Rather than asking "Does this word name a thing?" (which is debatable), we ask "Can this word be pluralized? Can it follow <em>the</em>?" (which we can test directly).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Two Questions</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When analyzing any word in a sentence, you must ask two separate questions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>What IS this word?</em> (form—its part of speech)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>What is this word DOING?</em> (function—its grammatical role)</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>These questions have different answers, and both answers matter. This is the <em>dual-identification principle</em>, and it will guide your analysis throughout this course.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Form: What a Word IS</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Form</em> refers to a word's part of speech—its inherent grammatical category. We determine form by examining the word's morphological properties (what endings it can take) and its typical syntactic behavior.</p>

    <p>For example, <em>happy</em> is an adjective. How do we know? Because it passes the tests for adjectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>It can be compared: <em>happier</em>, <em>happiest</em></p></li>
      <li><p>It can be modified by <em>very</em>: <em>very happy</em></p></li>
      <li><p>It can appear after linking verbs: <em>She seems happy</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These properties belong to the word itself, regardless of how it's used in any particular sentence.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Function: What a Word DOES</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Function</em> refers to the grammatical role a word plays in a specific sentence. The same word can perform different functions in different sentences—and sometimes a word's function differs from what we'd expect based on its form.</p>

    <p>Consider the word <em>poor</em>:</p>

    <p><em>The <em>poor</em> deserve our help.</em></p>

    <p>What is <em>poor</em>? By form, it's an adjective (it can be graded: <em>poorer</em>, <em>poorest</em>). But what is it doing in this sentence? It's functioning as a noun—it follows a determiner (<em>the</em>), it serves as the subject of the sentence, and it refers to a group of people. We call this an <em>adjective functioning nominally</em> (doing the job of a noun).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Form and Function Can Match or Differ</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Example 1: Form and function match</em></p>

    <p><em>She spoke <em>quietly</em>.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Form: <em>quietly</em> is an adverb (formed with <em>-ly</em> from adjective <em>quiet</em>)</p></li>
      <li><p>Function: <em>quietly</em> functions adverbially (it modifies the verb <em>spoke</em>, telling us how she spoke)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here form and function align—an adverb doing adverb work.</p>

    <p><em>Example 2: Form and function differ</em></p>

    <p><em>The <em>coffee</em> table needs dusting.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Form: <em>coffee</em> is a noun (it can be pluralized: <em>coffees</em>; it can follow determiners: <em>the coffee</em>)</p></li>
      <li><p>Function: <em>coffee</em> functions adjectivally (it modifies <em>table</em>, telling us what kind of table)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here a noun is doing the work typically done by adjectives.</p>

    <p><em>Example 3: Another mismatch</em></p>

    <p><em>She runs <em>fast</em>.</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Form: <em>fast</em> is typically an adjective (<em>a fast car</em>, <em>faster</em>, <em>fastest</em>)</p></li>
      <li><p>Function: <em>fast</em> functions adverbially (it modifies <em>runs</em>, telling us how she runs)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why This Matters</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The form/function distinction matters for three reasons:</p>

    <p><em>1. Words are flexible.</em> English allows words to shift between functions freely. Understanding this prevents you from making errors like "That can't be an adjective because it's modifying a verb."</p>

    <p><em>2. Labels depend on context.</em> You cannot fully describe a word's grammar without seeing it in a sentence. The word <em>walk</em> is a verb in "I walk to school" but a noun in "The walk was pleasant."</p>

    <p><em>3. Complete analysis requires both.</em> Saying "<em>poor</em> is an adjective" in the sentence "The poor deserve help" is incomplete. A full analysis recognizes both what the word is (adjective) and what it's doing (functioning as a noun).</p>

    <p>Throughout this chapter, we'll examine four major word classes. For each one, you'll learn both morphological tests (to identify form) and syntactic tests (to analyze function). Keep the dual-identification principle in mind: always identify both what a word <em>is</em> and what it's <em>doing</em>.</p>

    <title>What Are Open Classes?</title>

    <p>English words fall into two broad categories: <em>open classes</em> and <em>closed classes</em>. This chapter focuses on open classes; Chapter 6 addresses closed classes.</p>

    <p><em>Open classes</em> are word categories that readily accept new members. English speakers regularly create new nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Class</cell>
        <cell>Recent Additions</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>Nouns</em></cell>
        <cell><em>selfie</em>, <em>cryptocurrency</em>, <em>podcast</em>, <em>meme</em>, <em>influencer</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>Verbs</em></cell>
        <cell><em>google</em>, <em>tweet</em>, <em>zoom</em>, <em>ghost</em> (meaning to ignore), <em>stream</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>Adjectives</em></cell>
        <cell><em>viral</em>, <em>sustainable</em>, <em>gluten-free</em>, <em>binge-worthy</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>Adverbs</em></cell>
        <cell><em>literally</em> (emphatic), <em>lowkey</em>, <em>ironically</em> (new usage)</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>These four classes—nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs—contain the vast majority of English words and carry most of the content meaning in sentences. They are sometimes called <em>content words</em> or <em>lexical words</em>.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why Does It Matter That Classes Are &quot;Open&quot;?</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The openness of these classes tells us something profound about language: it's creative. We don't memorize a fixed list of nouns and then stop—we keep making new ones. When Bitcoin emerged, English speakers immediately needed a word, and <em>cryptocurrency</em> was coined. When a new social platform appeared, <em>tweet</em> became both a noun and a verb.</p>

    <p>This creativity follows rules. We don't randomly string sounds together; we use the morphological patterns from Chapter 4. A new noun meaning &quot;one who podcasts&quot; naturally becomes <em>podcaster</em>, following the same pattern that gave us <em>teacher</em> and <em>writer</em> centuries ago.</p>

    <p>Understanding open classes helps you:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>Identify parts of speech reliably</em> using formal tests rather than meaning</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Analyze phrase structure</em> by recognizing what can serve as a phrase's head</p></li>
      <li><p><em>See language change in action</em> as new words enter primarily through open classes</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Each open class has characteristic <em>morphological</em> properties (what endings the word can take) and <em>syntactic</em> properties (how the word behaves in sentences). The following sections examine each class in detail, providing tests you can use to identify membership and explaining how each class builds phrases.</p>

  <section xml:id="ch-05-open-classes-sec-53">
    <title>Phrases and Headwords</title>

    <p>Before examining individual word classes, we need to understand how words combine into larger units called <em>phrases</em>. In grammar, a phrase is a group of words that functions as a single unit within a sentence. Every phrase is built around one essential word—its <em>head</em>—and may include other words that modify or complete it.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Head of a Phrase</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The <em>head</em> is the most important word in a phrase—the word that determines what kind of phrase it is and cannot be removed without destroying the phrase. Think of the head as the nucleus around which everything else orbits.</p>

    <p>Consider this noun phrase:</p>

    <p><em>the tall student from Ohio</em></p>

    <p>Which word is essential? We can remove words one by one:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the tall student from Ohio</em> → <em>tall student from Ohio</em> (still works)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>tall student from Ohio</em> → <em>student from Ohio</em> (still works)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>student from Ohio</em> → <em>student</em> (still works)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>student</em> → ??? (remove <em>student</em> and nothing remains)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The word <em>student</em> is the head. Every other word in the phrase—<em>the</em>, <em>tall</em>, <em>from Ohio</em>—is optional. But <em>student</em> is required. Because the head is a noun, the whole phrase is a <em>noun phrase (NP)</em>.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Modifiers</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Modifiers</em> are the optional words that add information about the head. They come in two types:</p>

    <p><em>Pre-modifiers</em> appear before the head:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>In <em>the tall student</em>, both <em>the</em> and <em>tall</em> are pre-modifiers</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Post-modifiers</em> appear after the head:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>In <em>student from Ohio</em>, the phrase <em>from Ohio</em> is a post-modifier</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Modifiers expand the head, making it more specific. <em>Student</em> could be anyone; <em>the tall student from Ohio</em> narrows our focus to one particular person.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Four Major Phrase Types</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Each of the four open word classes serves as the head of a corresponding phrase type:</p>

        <cell><em>quite slowly</em></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>Understanding phrase structure is essential for grammatical analysis. When we diagram sentences or analyze syntax, we work with phrases, not just individual words.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Visualizing Phrase Structure</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>We can represent phrase structure using tree diagrams. Here's a simple noun phrase:</p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-np-simple">
      <caption>A simple noun phrase: <em>the tall student</em></caption>
      <image source="diagrams/new/ch05_np_simple.png" width="40%">
        <description>Syntax tree diagram showing the noun phrase "the tall student" with NP as the root, branching to DET (the), ADJ (tall), and N (student)</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[NP [DET the] [ADJP [ADJ tall]] [N student]]</c></p>

    <p>The tree shows that <em>the</em>, <em>tall</em>, and <em>student</em> combine to form a single NP. The head noun <em>student</em> determines the phrase type; the determiner and adjective are its pre-modifiers.</p>

    <p>A more complex noun phrase adds a post-modifier:</p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-np-with-pp">
      <caption>A noun phrase with a prepositional phrase post-modifier</caption>
      <image source="diagrams/new/ch05_np_with_pp.png" width="55%">
        <description>Syntax tree diagram showing "the tall student from Ohio" with nested PP containing another NP</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[NP [DET the] [ADJP [ADJ tall]] [N student] [PP [PREP from] [NP [N Ohio]]]]</c></p>

    <p>Notice that the post-modifier <em>from Ohio</em> is itself a phrase—a prepositional phrase (PP) containing its own NP. Phrases can nest inside other phrases, creating hierarchical structures.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Identifying the Head</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When you encounter a phrase, use this process to identify its head:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Ask: "Which word is essential—which word cannot be removed?"</p></li>
      <li><p>Confirm: "What part of speech is that word?"</p></li>
      <li><p>Label the phrase accordingly (NP if noun, VP if verb, etc.)</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let's practice:</p>

    <p><em>extremely proud of her achievement</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Remove <em>extremely</em>: <em>proud of her achievement</em> (still works)</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>of her achievement</em>: <em>extremely proud</em> (still works)</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>proud</em>: <em>extremely of her achievement</em> (broken)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The head is <em>proud</em>, an adjective. This is an <em>adjective phrase (AdjP)</em>.</p>

    <p><em>very quickly</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Remove <em>very</em>: <em>quickly</em> (still works)</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>quickly</em>: <em>very</em> (incomplete)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The head is <em>quickly</em>, an adverb. This is an <em>adverb phrase (AdvP)</em>.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why Phrase Structure Matters</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Understanding phrases helps you:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>Analyze sentence structure.</em> Sentences are built from phrases, and phrases from smaller phrases. Seeing these building blocks clarifies how sentences work.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Identify grammatical functions.</em> Phrases, not just words, perform grammatical roles. The <em>phrase</em> "the tall student from Ohio" serves as a subject—not just the word "student."</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Understand ambiguity.</em> Many ambiguous sentences can be explained through different possible phrase structures.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Write more effectively.</em> When you can see the structure of your sentences, you can vary and control them more deliberately.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the following sections, we'll examine each word class in detail. For each class, we'll begin by exploring how it forms phrases, then present the tests for identifying it.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-05-open-classes-sec-54">
    <title>Nouns</title>

    <p><em>Nouns</em> are the naming words of language—they identify the people, places, things, concepts, and ideas we talk about. Nouns are also the most common word class in English, making up roughly 37% of words in typical texts. Every sentence has at least one noun (or pronoun standing in for a noun), and many sentences have several.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Noun Phrases: How Nouns Work in Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Nouns rarely appear alone. Instead, they form the center of <em>noun phrases (NP)</em>—groups of words built around a noun head. Understanding noun phrases is essential because it's the phrase, not just the noun, that fills grammatical roles like subject and object.</p>

    <p><em>A simple noun phrase:</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-np-simple-nouns">
      <caption>A simple noun phrase with determiner, adjective, and head noun</caption>

        <description>Syntax tree for "the tall student" showing NP with DET, ADJ, and N branches</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[NP [DET the] [ADJP [ADJ tall]] [N student]]</c></p>

    <p>The noun <em>student</em> is the head—the essential word that determines the phrase type. The determiner <em>the</em> and adjective <em>tall</em> are pre-modifiers that add information about which student we mean.</p>

    <p><em>A larger noun phrase with post-modification:</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-np-complex">
      <caption>A complex noun phrase with multiple modifiers</caption>
      <image source="diagrams/new/ch05_np_complex.png" width="60%">

    </figure>
    <p><c>[NP [DET the] [ADJP [ADJ brilliant]] [ADJP [ADJ young]] [N student] [PP [PREP from] [NP [N Ohio]]]]</c></p>

    <p>Here we have multiple pre-modifiers (<em>the</em>, <em>brilliant</em>, <em>young</em>) and a prepositional phrase post-modifier (<em>from Ohio</em>). Notice how the PP contains its own NP (<em>Ohio</em>)—phrases nest inside phrases.</p>

    <p><em>Pre-modifiers</em> in noun phrases include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Determiners: <em>the</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>my</em>, <em>this</em>, <em>every</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Adjectives: <em>tall</em>, <em>beautiful</em>, <em>old</em>, <em>interesting</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Other nouns (functioning adjectivally): <em>coffee</em> (in <em>coffee table</em>), <em>history</em> (in <em>history professor</em>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Post-modifiers</em> in noun phrases include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Prepositional phrases: <em>the man <em>in the hat</em></em>, <em>a book <em>about linguistics</em></em></p></li>
      <li><p>Relative clauses: <em>the book <em>that I read</em></em>, <em>the student <em>who won</em></em></p></li>
      <li><p>Participial phrases: <em>the dog <em>running in the park</em></em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Identifying the Head Noun</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The head noun is the word you cannot remove. Test by eliminating words one at a time:</p>

    <p><em>The experienced history teacher from the local high school</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Remove <em>the</em>: <em>experienced history teacher from the local high school</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>experienced</em>: <em>history teacher from the local high school</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>history</em>: <em>teacher from the local high school</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>from the local high school</em>: <em>teacher</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>teacher</em>: ??? ✗</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The head is <em>teacher</em>. Everything else modifies it.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why Semantic Definitions Can Mislead</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The traditional definition of nouns—"words that name people, places, things, or ideas"—works much of the time. <em>Teacher</em>, <em>Paris</em>, <em>table</em>, and <em>freedom</em> are all nouns. But meaning can mislead us. Is <em>destruction</em> a "thing"? What about <em>arrival</em> or <em>swimming</em>? These are nouns too, but they seem to name actions rather than objects.</p>

    <p>The reliable way to identify nouns is through their grammatical behavior—specifically, through tests that reveal their morphological and syntactic properties.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Morphological Tests for Nouns</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Morphological tests examine what forms a word can take. Nouns have distinctive morphological properties that set them apart from other word classes.</p>

    <p><em>Test 1: Plural formation</em></p>

    <p>Nouns can typically be made plural. This is perhaps the most reliable morphological test for nouns:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>book</em> → <em>books</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>child</em> → <em>children</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>analysis</em> → <em>analyses</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>happiness</em> → <em>happinesses</em> (rare but grammatical)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you can pluralize a word, it's almost certainly a noun. Note that some nouns resist pluralization (mass nouns like <em>water</em>, <em>information</em>), but the fact that we can even ask the question &quot;Can this be plural?&quot; suggests noun-hood.</p>

    <p><em>Test 2: Possessive marking</em></p>

    <p>Nouns can take the possessive marker <em>'s</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the dog's tail</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Maria's book</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>the committee's decision</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other word classes cannot take this marker: we don't say <em>~~the happy's effect~~</em> or <em>~~the quickly's result~~</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Test 3: Noun-forming suffixes</em></p>

    <p>If a word ends in certain suffixes, it's likely a noun. These suffixes convert other word classes into nouns:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Suffix</cell>
        <cell>Examples</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>-tion/-sion</em></cell>
        <cell><em>action</em>, <em>decision</em>, <em>conclusion</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>-ness</em></cell>
        <cell><em>happiness</em>, <em>awkwardness</em>, <em>cleverness</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>-ity</em></cell>
        <cell><em>curiosity</em>, <em>generosity</em>, <em>ambiguity</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>-ment</em></cell>
        <cell><em>government</em>, <em>amazement</em>, <em>establishment</em></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><em>-er/-or</em></cell>
        <cell><em>teacher</em>, <em>actor</em>, <em>writer</em></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>When you see these endings, think &quot;noun.&quot;</p>

      <title>Syntactic Tests for Nouns</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Syntactic tests examine how a word behaves in sentences. Where can the word appear? What other words can accompany it?</p>

    <p><em>Test 1: The determiner test</em></p>

    <p>Nouns can follow words like <em>a</em>, <em>the</em>, <em>this</em>, <em>my</em>, and <em>every</em>. These words (called determiners) specifically introduce nouns:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the <em>proposal</em></em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>a <em>happiness</em></em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>every <em>decision</em></em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This test is powerful because determiners exclusively precede nouns. If <em>the</em> or <em>a</em> can go in front of a word, that word is functioning as a noun.</p>

    <p><em>Test 2: The adjective modification test</em></p>

    <p>Nouns can be modified by adjectives—words that describe qualities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the <em>new</em> proposal</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>a <em>great</em> happiness</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>every <em>important</em> decision</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Adjectives slot in between the determiner and the noun. If a word can appear in the position after an adjective, it's behaving as a noun.</p>

    <p><em>Test 3: The pronoun replacement test</em></p>

    <p>A noun (along with its modifiers) can be replaced by a pronoun like <em>it</em>, <em>they</em>, or <em>she</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>The new proposal</em> → <em>It</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>My older brother</em> → <em>He</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Those expensive books</em> → <em>They</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This test helps identify noun phrases—groups of words built around a noun.</p>

    <p><em>Test 4: The subject/object position test</em></p>

    <p>Nouns naturally fill the subject and object slots in sentences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Subject: <em><em>Books</em> are expensive.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Direct object: <em>I bought <em>books</em>.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Object of preposition: <em>I learned from <em>books</em>.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Subclasses of Nouns</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Not all nouns behave identically. Two important distinctions affect how nouns can be used.</p>

    <p><em>Common vs. Proper Nouns</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Common nouns</em> name general categories: <em>city</em>, <em>teacher</em>, <em>book</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Proper nouns</em> name specific, unique entities: <em>Chicago</em>, <em>Professor Smith</em>, <em>Friday</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Proper nouns are capitalized and often don't take determiners: <em>Chicago is large</em> (not <em>~~The Chicago~~</em>). When a proper noun does take a determiner, it often signals a different meaning: <em>the Amazon</em> (river) vs. <em>Amazon</em> (company).</p>

    <p><em>Count vs. Mass Nouns</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Count nouns</em> refer to discrete, countable entities: <em>book/books</em>, <em>idea/ideas</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Can be pluralized: <em>three books</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Take <em>a/an</em>: <em>a book</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Take number words: <em>several ideas</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Mass nouns</em> refer to undifferentiated substances or concepts: <em>water</em>, <em>information</em>, <em>furniture</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Cannot be pluralized: <em>~~informations~~</em>, <em>~~furnitures~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Cannot take <em>a/an</em>: <em>~~a furniture~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Take quantity words instead: <em>some water</em>, <em>much information</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Verbs</title>

    <p><em>Verbs</em> are the engine of the sentence. While nouns name things, verbs make things happen—or describe states of being. Every complete sentence requires a verb, and the verb determines much of the sentence's structure: how many participants are needed, what time frame is being discussed, whether the action is complete or ongoing.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Verb Phrases: How Verbs Work in Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Just as nouns head noun phrases, verbs head <em>verb phrases (VP)</em>. The verb phrase contains the main verb plus any complements or modifiers it requires. What makes verb phrases especially interesting is that different verbs require different structures.</p>

    <p><em>An intransitive verb phrase (no object required):</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-vp-intransitive">

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[VP [V slept]]</c></p>

    <p>The verb <em>slept</em> needs nothing after it—the subject can just sleep.</p>

    <p><em>A transitive verb phrase (requires an object):</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-vp-transitive">
      <caption>A transitive verb phrase with direct object</caption>
      <image source="diagrams/new/ch05_vp_transitive.png" width="35%">
        <description>Syntax tree showing VP with V (read) and NP (the book)</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[VP [V read] [NP [DET the] [N book]]]</c></p>

    <p>The verb <em>read</em> requires something to be read—the NP <em>the book</em> is its direct object.</p>

    <p><em>A ditransitive verb phrase (requires two objects):</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-vp-ditransitive">
      <caption>A ditransitive verb phrase with indirect and direct objects</caption>
      <image source="diagrams/new/ch05_vp_ditransitive.png" width="45%">

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[VP [V gave] [NP [PRON her]] [NP [DET a] [N present]]]</c></p>

    <p>The verb <em>gave</em> requires both a recipient (<em>her</em>) and a thing given (<em>a present</em>).</p>

    <p>This property—that verbs dictate what must follow them—is called the verb's <em>valency</em>. Chapter 8 explores valency patterns in detail. For now, notice that the verb is truly the head of the VP: it determines the entire structure of the phrase.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Identifying the Head Verb</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>In a verb phrase, the head verb is the word that carries the core meaning of the action or state. In complex verb phrases with auxiliaries, the <em>main verb</em> is the head:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>She <em>has been reading</em> the book.</em> — Head: <em>reading</em> (main verb)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>They <em>might have arrived</em> early.</em> — Head: <em>arrived</em> (main verb)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>The report <em>was written</em> yesterday.</em> — Head: <em>written</em> (main verb)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The auxiliaries (<em>has</em>, <em>been</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>have</em>, <em>was</em>) add grammatical information about tense, aspect, or voice, but the main verb supplies the core meaning.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Semantics vs. Grammar</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Semantically, verbs express actions (<em>run</em>, <em>build</em>, <em>think</em>), states (<em>know</em>, <em>believe</em>, <em>own</em>), or occurrences (<em>happen</em>, <em>become</em>, <em>appear</em>). But as with nouns, we identify verbs more reliably through grammatical tests.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Morphological Tests for Verbs</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Verbs in English have a distinctive set of forms—more than any other word class. If a word can take these various forms, it's a verb.</p>

    <p><em>Test 1: Past tense formation</em></p>

    <p>Verbs can be marked for past tense:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>walk</em> → <em>walked</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>see</em> → <em>saw</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>go</em> → <em>went</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is perhaps the most diagnostic test. If you can put a word into past tense, it's a verb: &quot;Yesterday, I ___ed&quot; (or an irregular past form).</p>

    <p><em>Test 2: Third-person singular present</em></p>

    <p>Verbs take <em>-s</em> when the subject is third-person singular (<em>he</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>it</em>):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>I walk</em> → <em>she walks</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>I see</em> → <em>he sees</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the only agreement marking English verbs still carry, but it's a reliable indicator of verb-hood.</p>

    <p><em>Test 3: Progressive form (-ing)</em></p>

    <p>Verbs can take the <em>-ing</em> suffix to form the progressive:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>walk</em> → <em>walking</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>see</em> → <em>seeing</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Every verb in English can take <em>-ing</em>. If you can add <em>-ing</em> to a word and use it after <em>be</em> (&quot;She is ___ing&quot;), it's a verb.</p>

    <p><em>Test 4: Participial forms</em></p>

    <p>Verbs have a past participle form (used with <em>have</em> and in passives):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>walk</em> → <em>walked</em> (regular)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>see</em> → <em>seen</em> (irregular)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>go</em> → <em>gone</em> (irregular)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Syntactic Tests for Verbs</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Test 1: The modal test</em></p>

    <p>Verbs can follow modal words like <em>can</em>, <em>will</em>, <em>might</em>, <em>should</em>, <em>must</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>can walk</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>will see</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>might go</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If a word can slot into &quot;She can ___,&quot; it's a verb.</p>

    <p><em>Test 2: The infinitive test</em></p>

    <p>Verbs can follow <em>to</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>to walk</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>to see</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>to understand</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The &quot;to ___&quot; construction (called the infinitive) is available only to verbs.</p>

    <p><em>Test 3: The negation test</em></p>

    <p>Verbs can be negated, typically using <em>do</em> + <em>not</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>She does not walk.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>I did not see it.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Verb Forms: The Principal Parts</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Every English verb has five forms, traditionally called the <em>principal parts</em>:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Form</cell>
        <cell>Regular (<em>walk</em>)</cell>
        <cell>Irregular (<em>see</em>)</cell>
        <cell>Irregular (<em>go</em>)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Base</cell>
        <cell>walk</cell>

      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Past</cell>
        <cell>walked</cell>
        <cell>saw</cell>
        <cell>went</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Past participle</cell>
        <cell>walked</cell>
        <cell>seen</cell>
        <cell>gone</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Present participle</cell>
        <cell>walking</cell>
        <cell>seeing</cell>
        <cell>going</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>3rd person singular</cell>
        <cell>walks</cell>
        <cell>sees</cell>
        <cell>goes</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Regular verbs</em> (the vast majority) form their past tense and past participle by adding <em>-ed</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Irregular verbs</em> form these parts unpredictably—you must memorize them. Common irregular verbs include <em>be</em>, <em>have</em>, <em>go</em>, <em>see</em>, <em>take</em>, <em>make</em>, <em>come</em>, <em>know</em>.</p>

    <title>Adjectives</title>

    <p><em>Adjectives</em> are the descriptors of language. They modify nouns, telling us what kind of thing something is, what quality it has, or which one we mean. A <em>tall</em> building, a <em>happy</em> child, an <em>interesting</em> problem—in each case, the adjective narrows down the noun, adding specificity.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adjective Phrases: How Adjectives Work in Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Adjectives form phrases just as nouns and verbs do. An <em>adjective phrase (AdjP)</em> has an adjective as its head, with optional modifiers before and after.</p>

    <p><em>A simple adjective phrase:</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-adjp-simple">

    </figure>
    <p><c>[ADJP [ADVP [ADV very]] [ADJ happy]]</c></p>

    <p>The degree adverb <em>very</em> intensifies the adjective <em>happy</em>.</p>

    <p><em>An adjective phrase with a post-modifier:</em></p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-ch05-adjp-complex">
      <caption>A complex adjective phrase with pre- and post-modifiers</caption>

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[ADJP [ADVP [ADV very]] [ADJ proud] [PP [PREP of] [NP [DET her] [N work]]]]</c></p>

    <p>Here the adjective <em>proud</em> is modified both by the degree adverb <em>very</em> (pre-modifier) and by the prepositional phrase <em>of her work</em> (post-modifier).</p>

    <p><em>Common pre-modifiers of adjectives:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Degree adverbs: <em>very</em>, <em>extremely</em>, <em>somewhat</em>, <em>quite</em>, <em>rather</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Common post-modifiers of adjectives:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Prepositional phrases: <em>proud <em>of her work</em></em>, <em>afraid <em>of the dark</em></em>, <em>interested <em>in linguistics</em></em>, <em>good <em>at math</em></em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Where Adjective Phrases Appear</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Adjective phrases appear in two main positions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Attributive position</em> (before a noun): <em>the [very tall] man</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Predicative position</em> (after a linking verb): <em>The man is [very tall].</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>When an AdjP appears attributively, it modifies the following noun directly. When it appears predicatively, it describes the subject of the sentence.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Identifying the Head Adjective</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Apply the same test: which word is essential?</p>

    <p><em>extremely proud of her remarkable achievement</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Remove <em>extremely</em>: <em>proud of her remarkable achievement</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>of her remarkable achievement</em>: <em>extremely proud</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>proud</em>: <em>extremely of her remarkable achievement</em> ✗</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The head is <em>proud</em>. The adverb <em>extremely</em> and the PP <em>of her remarkable achievement</em> both modify it.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>What Adjectives Do</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Unlike nouns and verbs, which often carry the core meaning of a sentence, adjectives enrich and qualify. They answer questions like "What kind?" (<em>a <em>wooden</em> table</em>), "Which one?" (<em>the <em>third</em> attempt</em>), and "What is it like?" (<em>She seems <em>nervous</em>.</em>).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Morphological Tests for Adjectives</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Test 1: Comparative and superlative forms</em></p>

    <p>Most adjectives can be graded—that is, they can express degrees of a quality:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>tall</em> → <em>taller</em> → <em>tallest</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>happy</em> → <em>happier</em> → <em>happiest</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>beautiful</em> → <em>more beautiful</em> → <em>most beautiful</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If a word can become comparative or superlative, it's almost certainly an adjective. This test distinguishes adjectives from nouns and verbs, which cannot be graded this way (we don't say <em>~~taller book~~</em> meaning &quot;more of a book&quot; or <em>~~he walked the walkedest~~</em>).</p>

    <p>*<em>Test 2: The </em>-ish<em> test</em>*</p>

    <p>Many adjectives accept the suffix <em>-ish</em>, meaning &quot;somewhat&quot;:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>tall</em> → <em>tallish</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>red</em> → <em>reddish</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>young</em> → <em>youngish</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a quick informal test. If <em>-ish</em> sounds natural, you likely have an adjective.</p>

    <p>*<em>Test 3: Adverb formation with </em>-ly***</p>

    <p>Many adjectives can become adverbs by adding <em>-ly</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>happy</em> → <em>happily</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>quick</em> → <em>quickly</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>careful</em> → <em>carefully</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This shows the close relationship between adjectives and adverbs—and also helps identify adjectives in the first place.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Syntactic Tests for Adjectives</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Test 1: The attributive position test</em></p>

    <p>Adjectives can appear between a determiner and a noun—this position, directly before the noun, is called <em>attributive</em> position:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the <em>tall</em> man</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>a <em>happy</em> child</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>the <em>interesting</em> book</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a defining characteristic. If a word can slot into &quot;the ___ noun,&quot; it's behaving as an adjective.</p>

    <p><em>Test 2: The predicative position test</em></p>

    <p>Adjectives can follow linking verbs like <em>be</em>, <em>seem</em>, <em>become</em>, and <em>appear</em>—this position, after the verb, is called <em>predicative</em> position:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>The man is <em>tall</em>.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>She seems <em>happy</em>.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>The book appears <em>interesting</em>.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most adjectives work in both positions. A few work in only one (see below).</p>

    <p>*<em>Test 3: The </em>very<em> test</em>*</p>

    <p>Adjectives can be modified by degree words like <em>very</em>, <em>extremely</em>, and <em>quite</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em><em>very</em> tall</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>extremely</em> happy</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>quite</em> interesting</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If <em>very</em> sounds natural before a word, that word is likely an adjective. (Nouns and verbs don't accept <em>very</em>: <em>~~very book~~</em>, <em>~~very walked~~</em>.)</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Special Classes of Adjectives</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Most adjectives are <em>gradable</em>—they can express degrees (<em>taller</em>, <em>very tall</em>). But some adjectives express absolute properties and resist grading:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>dead</em> — something is dead or not; <em>~~very dead~~</em> sounds odd</p></li>
      <li><p><em>unique</em> — traditionally, something is unique or not; <em>~~more unique~~</em> is contested</p></li>
      <li><p><em>pregnant</em> — grammatically ungradable, though metaphor sometimes changes this</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some adjectives are <em>attributive-only</em> (they can only appear before nouns):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the <em>main</em> reason</em> ✓ / <em>~~The reason is main~~</em> ✗</p></li>
      <li><p><em>a <em>mere</em> child</em> ✓ / <em>~~The child is mere~~</em> ✗</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Others are <em>predicative-only</em> (they can only appear after linking verbs):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>The child is <em>asleep</em></em> ✓ / <em>~~the asleep child~~</em> ✗</p></li>
      <li><p><em>She felt <em>afraid</em></em> ✓ / <em>~~the afraid woman~~</em> ✗</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Adverbs</title>

    <p><em>Adverbs</em> are the most versatile and varied word class in English. While nouns name, verbs act, and adjectives describe nouns, adverbs do a bit of everything: they can modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, and even entire sentences. This versatility makes them both useful and tricky to identify.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adverb Phrases: How Adverbs Work in Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Adverbs form phrases, though <em>adverb phrases (AdvP)</em> tend to be simpler than noun or verb phrases. An AdvP has an adverb as its head, often with another adverb (typically a degree modifier) modifying it.</p>

    <p><em>A simple adverb phrase:</em></p>

    <p><em>An adverb phrase with a degree modifier:</em></p>

      </image>
    </figure>
    <p><c>[ADVP [ADVP [ADV very]] [ADV quickly]]</c></p>

    <p>The degree adverb <em>very</em> intensifies the manner adverb <em>quickly</em>.</p>

    <p>Adverb phrases can grow by stacking degree modifiers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><em>quickly</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>very quickly</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>rather too quickly</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Where Adverb Phrases Function</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The traditional definition—"adverbs modify verbs"—captures only part of the picture. Adverb phrases can modify several different elements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Modifying verbs:</em> <em>She spoke [very quietly].</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Modifying adjectives:</em> <em>She is [extremely] talented.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Modifying other adverbs:</em> <em>She works [very] hard.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Modifying sentences:</em> <em>[Unfortunately], she couldn't attend.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In all four cases, an adverb is doing the modifying—but each targets a different element.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Identifying the Head Adverb</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>As with other phrase types, the head is the essential word:</p>

    <p><em>quite remarkably quickly</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Remove <em>quite</em>: <em>remarkably quickly</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>remarkably</em>: <em>quite quickly</em> ✓</p></li>
      <li><p>Remove <em>quickly</em>: <em>quite remarkably</em> (changes meaning significantly—<em>quickly</em> is the main manner adverb)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this case, <em>quickly</em> is the head—it expresses the core manner meaning. <em>Quite</em> and <em>remarkably</em> are degree modifiers that intensify it.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Versatility Challenge</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Consider these sentences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>She spoke <em>quietly</em>.</em> (modifies verb)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>She is <em>extremely</em> talented.</em> (modifies adjective)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>She works <em>very</em> hard.</em> (modifies adverb)</p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>Unfortunately</em>, she couldn't attend.</em> (modifies entire sentence)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In all four cases, the bolded word is an adverb—but each is doing different work. This versatility is what makes adverbs both powerful and tricky to identify.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Morphological Tests for Adverbs</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>*<em>Test 1: The </em>-ly<em> suffix</em>*</p>

    <p>Many adverbs are formed by adding <em>-ly</em> to adjectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>quick</em> → <em>quickly</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>happy</em> → <em>happily</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>careful</em> → <em>carefully</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a reliable pattern: if you see <em>-ly</em> on what looks like an adjective, you probably have an adverb. But be careful—some <em>-ly</em> words are adjectives (<em>friendly</em>, <em>lovely</em>, <em>costly</em>), and many common adverbs don't end in <em>-ly</em> at all (<em>fast</em>, <em>well</em>, <em>always</em>, <em>never</em>, <em>here</em>, <em>there</em>).</p>

    <p><em>Test 2: Comparative/superlative forms</em></p>

    <p>Some adverbs can be graded, just like adjectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>fast</em> → <em>faster</em> → <em>fastest</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>soon</em> → <em>sooner</em> → <em>soonest</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>quickly</em> → <em>more quickly</em> → <em>most quickly</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>But many common adverbs cannot: <em>~~very-er~~</em>, <em>~~always-est~~</em>, <em>~~therefore-er~~</em>. For these, we must rely on syntactic tests.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Syntactic Tests for Adverbs</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Test 1: Modifying verbs</em></p>

    <p>This is the classic adverb function. Adverbs appear near verbs and describe how, when, where, or how often the action occurs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>She spoke <em>quietly</em>.</em> (how)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>He <em>always</em> arrives late.</em> (frequency)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>They <em>suddenly</em> disappeared.</em> (manner/time)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Test 2: Modifying adjectives</em></p>

    <p>Adverbs, especially degree adverbs, can intensify or qualify adjectives:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>a <em>very</em> tall building</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>an <em>extremely</em> difficult problem</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>surprisingly</em> easy</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is how <em>very</em>, <em>quite</em>, <em>extremely</em>, and <em>rather</em> typically function.</p>

    <p><em>Test 3: Modifying other adverbs</em></p>

    <p>Adverbs can stack, with one adverb modifying another:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>She spoke <em>very</em> quietly.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>He runs <em>quite</em> fast.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>It happened <em>rather</em> suddenly.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Test 4: Modifying sentences</em></p>

    <p>Some adverbs can modify an entire sentence, typically appearing at the beginning and expressing the speaker's attitude:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em><em>Unfortunately</em>, I can't attend.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>Clearly</em>, we have a problem.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>Apparently</em>, they've left.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are called <em>sentence adverbs</em> or <em>commenting adverbs</em>.</p>

    <p><em>Test 5: The attributive position test (negative)</em></p>

    <p>Here's a crucial way to distinguish adverbs from adjectives: adverbs <em>cannot</em> appear in attributive position (between a determiner and a noun):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>the tall man</em> ✓ (<em>tall</em> is an adjective)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>~~the quickly man~~</em> ✗ (<em>quickly</em> is an adverb)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>~~the often problem~~</em> ✗ (<em>often</em> is an adverb)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If a word <em>can</em> appear in &quot;the ___ noun&quot; position, it's an adjective. If it <em>cannot</em>, it might be an adverb.</p>
