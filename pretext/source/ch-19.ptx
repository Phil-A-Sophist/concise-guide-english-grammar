    <title>Organizing Information</title>

    <p>How you arrange information within and across sentences affects how easily readers follow your ideas.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Given-New Contract</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Effective prose moves from <em>given</em> (known) information to <em>new</em> information:</p>

    <p><em>Given</em>: What the reader already knows</p>

    <p><em>New</em>: What you're adding</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"The study examined workplace stress. <em>This stress</em> affects employee health."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The second sentence begins with given information (This stress—referring to what we just discussed) and ends with new information (affects employee health).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Violating the Contract</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When new information comes first, readers struggle:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~Employee health is affected by this stress.~~</em> (new before given)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Readers work harder because they encounter unknown information before they've been oriented.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Topic and Comment</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Sentences typically have a <em>topic</em> (what the sentence is about) and a <em>comment</em> (what's said about it).</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Topic: <em>The proposal</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Comment: <em>was rejected by the committee.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Keeping topics consistent helps readers track your ideas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>The proposal was submitted last week. <em>It</em> was reviewed by experts. <em>The proposal</em> was ultimately approved.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Shifting topics erratically creates confusion.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-19-organization-and-concision-sec-192">
    <title>End-Focus and End-Weight</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>End-Focus</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>English naturally stresses sentence-final position. Place important information at the end:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"The winner was <em>Maria</em>." (focus on Maria)</p></li>
      <li><p>Maria won the competition. (focus on winning)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>End-Weight</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Heavy (long, complex) elements work better at sentence end:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Awkward: That she would resign after thirty years surprised everyone.</p></li>
      <li><p>Better: "It surprised everyone <em>that she would resign after thirty years</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is why extraposition and passive voice are useful—they help manage end-weight.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-19-organization-and-concision-sec-193">
    <title>Cohesion and Coherence</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Cohesion</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Cohesion</em> refers to the linguistic ties between sentences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Repetition: <em>The proposal... This proposal...</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Pronouns: <em>The committee... They...</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Synonyms: <em>The building... The structure...</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Conjunctions: However, Therefore, In addition</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Coherence</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Coherence</em> is the logical connection of ideas. Text can be cohesive without being coherent if the ideas don't logically connect.</p>

    <p>Both are needed for readable prose.</p>

    <title>Nominalization and Verb Strength</title>

    <p><em>Nominalization</em> is turning a verb into a noun. While sometimes useful, excessive nominalization creates wordy, weak prose.</p>

      <title>When Nominalization Works</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Nominalizations are useful when the noun form serves a specific purpose:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>As subjects: <em>The investigation revealed problems.</em> (investigation as topic)</p></li>
      <li><p>To refer back: <em>This decision was controversial.</em> (referring to previous content)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key is avoiding unnecessary nominalization that buries the action.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-19-organization-and-concision-sec-196">
    <title>Active vs. Passive for Concision</title>

    <p>Active voice is often more concise than passive:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Passive: <em>The report was written by the committee.</em> (8 words)</p></li>
      <li><p>Active: <em>The committee wrote the report.</em> (5 words)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, passive can be more concise when the agent is obvious or irrelevant:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Active: <em>Someone stole my car.</em> (4 words)</p></li>
      <li><p>Passive: <em>My car was stolen.</em> (4 words—same length, but agent-free)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Choose based on what's most efficient for your purpose.</p>

    <title>Revision Strategies</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Shrink Test</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Can you cut 10-20% of your draft without losing meaning? Most first drafts can be tightened significantly.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Read Aloud</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Wordy passages often sound awkward when read aloud. Trust your ear.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Ask &quot;Do I need this word?&quot;</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>For every word, ask whether removing it would change meaning. If not, consider cutting it.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Watch for Patterns</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>If you frequently use certain wordy constructions (it is, there are, the fact that), search for them specifically during revision.</p>

    <title>Homework: Organization and Concision</title>

    <p><em>Instructions:</em> Revise each passage to improve given-to-new information flow.</p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 2.</em> <em>Many complications arose during the project. The deadline was extended because of these complications.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 3.</em> Explain the "given-new contract" in your own words. Why does putting given information first help readers?</p>

    <p><em>Instructions:</em> Cut redundant words and phrases.</p>

    <p><em>Question 4.</em> <em>The basic fundamentals of grammar are essential and necessary for clear writing.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 5.</em> <em>She made a decision to completely finish the project before the final deadline.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 6.</em> <em>In the event that you need assistance, I am able to help you.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 7.</em> <em>We should return back to the original plan that we started out with in the beginning.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Instructions:</em> Revise each sentence to replace weak nominalizations with stronger verbs.</p>

    <p><em>Question 8.</em> <em>The committee made an examination of the evidence.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 9.</em> <em>We will give consideration to your proposal.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 10.</em> <em>The researchers reached the conclusion that the treatment was effective.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Question 11.</em> <em>The company made an announcement about the acquisition of its competitor.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p><em>Instructions:</em> Revise each passage for both organization and concision. Apply multiple strategies.</p>

    <p><em>Question 12.</em> <em>It is important to note that due to the fact that there were many problems that arose during the investigation, the investigators made a decision to conduct a thorough re-examination of all of the evidence that was previously collected by the team.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p>Strategies used:</p>

    <p><em>Question 13.</em> <em>At this point in time, it has come to our attention that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed. An investigation will be conducted by the committee. A report on the findings will be submitted by them at a later date.</em></p>

    <p>Revised:</p>

    <p>Strategies used:</p>

    <p><em>Question 14.</em> Find a paragraph from your own writing (an essay, email, report, etc.). Apply the "shrink test": try to cut 15-20% of the words without losing meaning.</p>

    <p>Original paragraph (with word count):</p>

    <p>Revised paragraph (with word count):</p>

    <p>What did you cut? Were there patterns in your wordiness?</p>

    <p><em>Question 15.</em> The chapter suggests that concision is not about being brief at all costs—it's about saying what needs to be said without unnecessary words. In 1-2 paragraphs, reflect: When might wordiness be a problem in your writing? Are there contexts where more formal, elaborate language might actually be appropriate?</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Organize information by moving from <em>given to new</em>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Place <em>emphasis</em> at sentence end; place <em>heavy elements</em> at end.</p></li>
      <li><p>Create <em>cohesion</em> through repetition, pronouns, and transitions.</p></li>
      <li><p>Eliminate <em>wordiness</em>: redundant pairs, empty phrases, unnecessary nominalizations.</p></li>
