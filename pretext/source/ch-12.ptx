    <title>Adverbs vs. Adverbials: Form vs. Function</title>

    <p>Understanding the distinction between <term>adverbs</term> (a form/part of speech) and <term>adverbials</term> (a function) is crucial for accurate grammatical analysis.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adverb as Form</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>An adverb is a part of speech—a word class with particular morphological and syntactic characteristics (Chapter 5). Adverbs often end in <foreign>-ly</foreign>, can modify verbs/adjectives/adverbs, and cannot appear between determiner and noun.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>quickly, carefully, often, very, however</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adverbial as Function</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>An adverbial is any word, phrase, or clause that <em>functions</em> to modify a verb, adjective, adverb, or sentence. This is a functional category, not a form category.</p>

    <p>Key insight: All adverbs functioning as modifiers are adverbials, but not all adverbials are adverbs.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-12-adverbials-sec-122">
    <title>Structures That Function as Adverbials</title>

    <p>Many different structures can serve the adverbial function.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>1. Adverb Phrases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The prototypical adverbial is an adverb phrase:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She spoke <em>quietly</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He arrived <em>very late</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>They finished <em>remarkably quickly</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>2. Prepositional Phrases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Prepositional phrases commonly function as adverbials:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She works <em>in the city</em>.</foreign> (place)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He arrived <em>at noon</em>.</foreign> (time)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>They spoke <em>with enthusiasm</em>.</foreign> (manner)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>We left <em>because of the weather</em>.</foreign> (reason)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>3. Noun Phrases (Temporal/Spatial)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Certain noun phrases function adverbially, especially those indicating time or direction:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She arrived <em>yesterday</em>.</foreign> (time)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>They met <em>last week</em>.</foreign> (time)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>The bird flew <em>north</em>.</foreign> (direction)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>We walked <em>two miles</em>.</foreign> (extent)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>4. Adverb Clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Entire clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions function as adverbials:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>When the bell rang</em>, students left.</foreign> (time)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>She succeeded <em>because she worked hard</em>.</foreign> (reason)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Although it rained</em>, we continued.</foreign> (concession)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>If you need help</em>, call me.</foreign> (condition)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>5. Infinitive Phrases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Infinitive phrases can function as adverbials (especially of purpose):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She came <em>to help</em>.</foreign> (purpose)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He studied hard <em>to pass the exam</em>.</foreign> (purpose)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>To succeed</em>, you must practice.</foreign> (purpose)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>6. Participial Phrases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Participial phrases can function adverbially:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Knowing the answer</em>, she raised her hand.</foreign> (reason/cause)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He left, <em>having finished his work</em>.</foreign> (time/reason)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Exhausted</em>, she fell asleep.</foreign> (reason)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Types of Adverbials: Adjuncts, Disjuncts, and Conjuncts</title>

    <p>Linguists distinguish three functional types of adverbials.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adjuncts</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Adjuncts</term> are integrated into clause structure, modifying the verb or clause content directly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She spoke <em>quietly</em>.</foreign> (how she spoke)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He arrived <em>at noon</em>.</foreign> (when he arrived)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>They live <em>in Boston</em>.</foreign> (where they live)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Adjuncts are part of the proposition—they can be focused, questioned, or negated:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She spoke QUIETLY.</foreign> (emphasis)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>Did she speak quietly?</foreign> (question)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>She didn't speak quietly.</foreign> (negation)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Disjuncts</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Disjuncts</term> comment on the whole sentence from an external perspective, expressing the speaker's attitude or evaluating truth:</p>

    <p>Attitude/Stance disjuncts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Unfortunately</em>, we lost.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Frankly</em>, I don't care.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Surprisingly</em>, she agreed.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Honestly</em>, I have no idea.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Truth/Domain disjuncts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Clearly</em>, this is wrong.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Obviously</em>, he's guilty.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Technically</em>, it's legal.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Politically</em>, it's controversial.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Disjuncts are not part of the proposition:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><delete>Did unfortunately we lose?</delete></foreign> (cannot question)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>It's not the case that unfortunately we lost.</foreign> (negation doesn't target the disjunct)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Conjuncts</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Conjuncts</term> connect sentences or clauses, showing logical relationships:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She was tired. <em>However</em>, she continued.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>The evidence is strong. <em>Therefore</em>, we should proceed.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>First, read the instructions. <em>Then</em>, begin the test.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>I disagree. <em>Nevertheless</em>, I respect your view.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Common conjuncts: <foreign>however, therefore, nevertheless, moreover, furthermore, consequently, thus, indeed, in fact, on the other hand</foreign></p>

    <title>Adverb Clause Structure</title>

    <p><term>Adverb clauses</term> are dependent clauses that function as adverbials, introduced by subordinating conjunctions.</p>

  <section xml:id="ch-12-adverbials-sec-126">
    <title>Adverbial Position</title>

    <p>Adverbials can appear in different positions, affecting emphasis and information flow.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Initial Position</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>At the beginning of the sentence:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Yesterday</em>, she arrived.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>In the morning</em>, we'll leave.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Frankly</em>, I disagree.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Initial position often signals topic or sets the scene.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Medial Position</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Between subject and verb, or within the verb phrase:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She <em>often</em> works late.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He has <em>always</em> been reliable.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>They will <em>probably</em> arrive soon.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Medial position is common for frequency adverbs and some manner adverbs.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Final Position</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>At the end of the sentence:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She arrived <em>yesterday</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>We'll leave <em>in the morning</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>He spoke <em>quietly</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Final position is the default for many adverbials, especially manner and place.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Position and Focus</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Moving an adverbial to a different position can change emphasis:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She spoke quietly <em>in the library</em>.</foreign> (neutral)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>In the library</em>, she spoke quietly.</foreign> (library emphasized)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>She spoke <em>in the library</em> quietly.</foreign> (quietness emphasized)</p></li>
