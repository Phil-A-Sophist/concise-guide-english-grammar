    <title>Morphemes: The Building Blocks</title>

    <p><term>Morphology</term> is the study of word structure and word formation. The fundamental unit of morphology is the <term>morpheme</term>—the smallest unit of language that carries meaning. A morpheme is a collection of sounds (or letters, in writing) that expresses a thought or concept.</p>

    <p>Words consist of one or more morphemes connected together. Understanding how to identify and analyze morphemes gives you insight into how English builds its vocabulary and how speakers create and understand new words.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Free and Bound Morphemes</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Morphemes fall into two categories based on whether they can stand alone:</p>

    <p><term>Free morphemes</term> (also called bases or roots) can function as independent words. They carry the core meaning of a word.</p>

    <p>Examples of free morphemes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>boy</q>, <q>girl</q>, <q>walk</q>, <q>happy</q>, <q>book</q>, <q>run</q></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><term>Bound morphemes</term> cannot stand alone as words; they must attach to other morphemes. Most bound morphemes in English are affixes—prefixes that attach before the base or suffixes that attach after it.</p>

    <p>Examples of bound morphemes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Prefixes: <q>un-</q>, <q>re-</q>, <q>pre-</q>, <q>mis-</q>, <q>dis-</q></p></li>
      <li><p>Suffixes: <q>-ness</q>, <q>-ly</q>, <q>-able</q>, <q>-tion</q>, <q>-er</q>, <q>-ed</q>, <q>-ing</q></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Morpheme Analysis Examples</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Let's practice identifying morphemes in words:</p>

    <p><q>Big</q> — One free morpheme</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>big</q> = free</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Bigger</q> — Two morphemes</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>big</q> = free morpheme</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-er</q> = bound morpheme (comparative)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Unbelievable</q> — Three morphemes</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>un-</q> = bound morpheme (prefix meaning "not")</p></li>
      <li><p><q>believe</q> = free morpheme</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-able</q> = bound morpheme (suffix meaning "capable of")</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Rewriters</q> — Four morphemes</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>re-</q> = bound morpheme (prefix meaning "again")</p></li>
      <li><p><q>write</q> = free morpheme</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-er</q> = bound morpheme (suffix meaning "one who")</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-s</q> = bound morpheme (plural marker)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Expectantly</q> — Three morphemes</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>expect</q> = free morpheme</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-ant</q> = bound morpheme (forms adjective)</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-ly</q> = bound morpheme (forms adverb)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Common Morphemes by Word Class</title>

    <p>English uses bound morphemes productively to create words belonging to different word classes. These affixes are <term>productive</term>—English speakers use them freely to create new words. You've probably encountered <q>unfriend,</q> <q>unsubscribe,</q> and <q>retweet,</q> none of which existed thirty years ago. The patterns are so reliable that you could invent a word right now and other English speakers would understand it immediately.</p>

    <p>The following tables organize common English affixes by the word class they typically create.</p>

      <title>Productivity and New Words</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>These affixes are called <term>productive</term> because English speakers actively use them to create new words. Consider some recent additions to English:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>unfriend</q> (un- + friend) — to remove someone from social media</p></li>
      <li><p><q>doomscrolling</q> (doom + scroll + -ing) — obsessively reading bad news</p></li>
      <li><p><q>rewatchable</q> (re- + watch + -able) — worth watching again</p></li>
      <li><p><q>influencer</q> (influence + -er) — social media personality</p></li>
      <li><p><q>podcaster</q> (podcast + -er) — one who creates podcasts</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These words didn't exist twenty years ago, yet English speakers immediately understand them. This is morphological productivity in action—the same patterns that created <q>unhappy</q> and <q>teacher</q> centuries ago continue to generate new vocabulary today.</p>

  <section xml:id="ch-04-morphology-and-word-structure-sec-43">
    <title>Morpheme Boundaries</title>

    <p>One of the trickiest aspects of morpheme analysis is determining where morphemes begin and end—especially with words borrowed from other languages. Many English words came from Latin, Greek, and French, bringing with them pieces that <em>look</em> like affixes but don't function as morphemes for modern English speakers.</p>

    <p>Before we address these tricky cases, let's practice the correct process for analyzing morphemes in straightforward words.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Morpheme Analysis</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When analyzing a word's morphemes, work systematically: identify the base (free morpheme), then examine what's attached to it. Here are three examples showing the step-by-step process.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Example 1: <q>unhappy</q></title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Start by finding the free morpheme—the part that can stand alone as a word:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>happy</q> is a word in English ✓</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now check what's attached:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>un-</q> appears before <q>happy</q>; this is the prefix meaning "not"</p></li>
      <li><p><q>un-</q> is a bound morpheme (it cannot stand alone)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Result: <q>un-</q> (bound) + <q>happy</q> (free) = 2 morphemes</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Example 2: <q>rethinking</q></title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Find the free morpheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>think</q> is a word in English ✓</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check what's attached before the base:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>re-</q> appears before <q>think</q>; this is the prefix meaning "again"</p></li>
      <li><p><q>re-</q> is a bound morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check what's attached after the base:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>-ing</q> appears after <q>think</q>; this suffix forms the present participle</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-ing</q> is a bound morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Result: <q>re-</q> (bound) + <q>think</q> (free) + <q>-ing</q> (bound) = 3 morphemes</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Example 3: <q>carelessness</q></title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Find the free morpheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>care</q> is a word in English ✓</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check for prefixes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>None present</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check for suffixes (work from the end inward):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>-ness</q> appears at the end; this suffix forms nouns meaning "state of"</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-less</q> appears between <q>care</q> and <q>-ness</q>; this suffix means "without"</p></li>
      <li><p>Both are bound morphemes</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Result: <q>care</q> (free) + <q>-less</q> (bound) + <q>-ness</q> (bound) = 3 morphemes</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Incorrect Morpheme Analysis</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Now let's look at common mistakes in morpheme analysis. The fundamental principle to remember is:</p>

    <p><em>A word can only be divided into morphemes if the base is a word in modern English.</em></p>

    <p>This rule keeps our analysis grounded in what speakers actually know, rather than what historical linguists can reconstruct. Morphemes are psychological units—pieces that speakers recognize as meaningful. When you hear <q>unhappy,</q> you recognize both <q>un-</q> and <q>happy</q> as meaningful parts because <q>happy</q> is a word you know.</p>

    <p><em>Type 1: Non-Existent Bases</em></p>

    <p>Some words look like they contain familiar affixes, but the remaining "base" isn't actually a word in English.</p>

    <p><q>Ugly</q> ≠ <q>ug</q> + <q>-ly</q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>Ug</q> is not a word in English ✗</p></li>
      <li><p>One morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Pretty</q> ≠ <q>pret</q> + <q>-ty</q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>Pret</q> is not a word in English ✗</p></li>
      <li><p>One morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Type 2: Historical Parts That Have Fused</em></p>

    <p>Many English words came from Latin, Greek, or French with internal structure that no longer functions for modern speakers. Consider the word <q>receive.</q> It begins with <q>re-,</q> which often means "again" in English (<q>rewrite,</q> <q>rebuild,</q> <q>reconsider</q>). And the rest of the word looks like it might be <q>ceive.</q> But ask yourself: Can you <q>ceive</q> something? Is <q>ceive</q> a word? Unless you're a Latin scholar who knows that <q>capere</q> meant "to take," the answer is no.</p>

    <p><q>Deceive</q> ≠ <q>de-</q> + <q>ceive</q></p>

    <p><em>Type 3: Coincidental Resemblance</em></p>

    <p>Sometimes a word contains a sequence of sounds that happens to match an existing word or affix, but the word's meaning has nothing to do with those parts. The word wasn't built from those pieces.</p>

    <p><q>Understand</q> ≠ <q>under</q> + <q>stand</q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Although <q>under</q> and <q>stand</q> are both English words, <q>understand</q> doesn't mean "to stand under something"</p></li>
      <li><p>The word came into English as a unit with its own meaning</p></li>
      <li><p>One morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Carpet</q> ≠ <q>car</q> + <q>pet</q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Although <q>car</q> and <q>pet</q> are both English words, a carpet isn't a pet for your car!</p></li>
      <li><p>One morpheme</p></li>

    <p><q>Breakfast</q> = <q>break</q> + <q>fast</q></p>

      <li><p>This one IS a compound—it literally means "breaking the fast" (the overnight period without eating)</p></li>
      <li><p>Two morphemes</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The test: Does the word's meaning derive from combining the meanings of the parts? If not, it's a single morpheme regardless of what sequences it contains.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Borderline Cases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some words present genuine challenges:</p>

    <p><em>Words with archaic bases:</em> If the base existed in Old English but not modern English, treat the word as one morpheme.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>overwhelm</q> (<q>whelm</q> is archaic) = 1 morpheme</p></li>
      <li><p><q>unkempt</q> (<q>kempt</q> is archaic) = 1 morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Latin/Greek borrowings:</em> If the base comes from Latin or Greek and isn't an English word, treat it as one morpheme.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>construct,</q> <q>instruct,</q> <q>destruct</q> = 1 morpheme each</p></li>
      <li><p><q>receive,</q> <q>perceive,</q> <q>conceive</q> = 1 morpheme each</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Additional Morphemes on Borrowed Words</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Even when a borrowed word is a single morpheme, English speakers can still add English affixes to it. Those affixes count as separate morphemes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>constructed</q> = <q>construct</q> + <q>-ed</q> (2 morphemes)</p></li>
      <li><p><q>receiving</q> = <q>receive</q> + <q>-ing</q> (2 morphemes)</p></li>
      <li><p><q>destruction</q> = This is trickier—<q>destruction</q> came into English as a complete word from Latin, so it's 1 morpheme. But <q>destructive</q> in modern English is <q>destruction</q> minus <q>-ion</q> plus <q>-ive</q>? No—both <q>destruction</q> and <q>destructive</q> are borrowed as units. However, <q>destructively</q> = <q>destructive</q> + <q>-ly</q> (2 morphemes) because <q>-ly</q> is a productive English suffix added to the borrowed word.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Compounds</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A <term>compound</term> is a word formed from two or more free morphemes combined together. English readily forms compounds.</p>

    <p>Noun + Noun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>bookcase,</q> <q>sunflower,</q> <q>bedroom,</q> <q>football</q></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Adjective + Noun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>blackboard,</q> <q>highway,</q> <q>smartphone</q></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Verb + Noun:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>breakfast</q> (break + fast), <q>pickpocket</q></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Noun + Verb:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>sunrise,</q> <q>haircut</q></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In English, compounds typically have primary stress on the first element:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>BLACK</em>board (compound: a board for writing)</p></li>
      <li><p>black <em>BOARD</em> (phrase: a board that is black)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>GREEN</em>house (compound: building for plants)</p></li>
      <li><p>green <em>HOUSE</em> (phrase: a house painted green)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>When analyzing morphemes in compounds, count each free morpheme separately:</p>

    <p><q>Bookshelves</q> = 3 morphemes</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>book</q> = free</p></li>
      <li><p><q>shelf</q> = free</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-s</q> = bound (plural)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><q>Sunflowers</q> = 3 morphemes</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>sun</q> = free</p></li>
      <li><p><q>flower</q> = free</p></li>
      <li><p><q>-s</q> = bound (plural)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember to apply the English base rule even with compounds. Some words look like they might be compounds but aren't:</p>

    <p><q>Together</q> ≠ <q>to</q> + <q>get</q> + <q>her</q></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>This word doesn't combine the meanings <q>to,</q> <q>get,</q> and <q>her</q></p></li>
      <li><p>One morpheme</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Morphemes and Writing: Strategic Word Choice</title>

    <p>The affixes introduced in Section 4.2 do more than build vocabulary—they give writers choices at the sentence level. Understanding how derivational morphemes work allows you to reshape sentences for clarity, concision, and emphasis. This section explores two ways morphological knowledge improves writing: using affixes for economy and understanding the trade-offs of nominalization.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Affixes for Economy</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Many common affixes let you express in one word what might otherwise require a phrase. Consider these pairs:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Descriptive Phrase</cell>
        <cell>Affixed Form</cell>
        <cell>Morpheme</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>read again</cell>
        <cell>reread</cell>
        <cell>re- (repetition)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>judged wrongly</cell>
        <cell>misjudged</cell>
        <cell>mis- (error)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>not happy</cell>
        <cell>unhappy</cell>
        <cell>un- (negation)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>in a careful manner</cell>
        <cell>carefully</cell>
        <cell>-ly (manner)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>one who teaches</cell>
        <cell>teacher</cell>
        <cell>-er (agent)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>before the war</cell>
        <cell>prewar</cell>
        <cell>pre- (temporal)</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>The affixed forms are often more concise and direct. Compare:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>I read the report for a second time.</q> (8 words)</p></li>
      <li><p><q>I reread the report.</q> (4 words)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The second version says the same thing in half the words. When you recognize that <q>re-</q> means "again," you can deploy it strategically rather than spelling out the concept with a phrase.</p>

    <p>However, the longer form is sometimes preferable. Consider emphasis: <q>I read that report <em>yet another time</em></q> stresses the repetition more than <q>I reread</q> does. The phrase also allows modification—<q>I read it <em>one more time</em></q> or <q>for the <em>third</em> time</q>—that the prefix cannot accommodate. And some affixed forms sound awkward: <q>She worked unusually diligently</q> is clunkier than <q>She worked with unusual diligence.</q></p>

    <p>The choice depends on context. Ask yourself: Is concision the priority? Does the longer form add emphasis or information? Does the affixed form sound natural?</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Nominalization: A Special Case</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Nominalization</term> occurs when a verb or adjective is converted into a noun, typically through suffixes like <q>-tion,</q> <q>-ment,</q> <q>-ness,</q> <q>-ity,</q> and <q>-ance.</q> You encountered these in Section 4.2 as noun-forming morphemes. Now consider how using them affects your prose.</p>

    <p>Compare these sentences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><q>The committee examined the evidence.</q> (verb: <q>examined</q>)</p></li>
      <li><p><q>The committee conducted an examination of the evidence.</q> (nominalization: <q>examination</q>)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first version is more direct—the action sits in the verb where readers expect it. The second buries the action inside a noun phrase, requiring extra words (<q>conducted,</q> <q>of</q>) to make a complete sentence.</p>

    <p>Excessive nominalization creates what writing scholar Helen Sword calls "zombie nouns"—abstract nouns that drain the life from prose. Consider this heavily nominalized passage:</p>

    <p><q>The implementation of the new system led to an improvement in the efficiency of operations and a reduction in the occurrence of errors.</q></p>

    <p>Revised with verbs restored:</p>

    <p><q>Implementing the new system improved operational efficiency and reduced errors.</q></p>

    <p>The revision is clearer, more direct, and nearly half as long.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>When Nominalization Strengthens Writing</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Despite these cautions, nominalization serves legitimate purposes:</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Creating necessary concepts</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some ideas exist primarily as nouns: <q>justice,</q> <q>education,</q> <q>democracy,</q> <q>freedom.</q> You cannot easily express <q>We value education</q> using the verb <q>educate</q> without changing the meaning.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Building cohesion</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Nominalizations help connect sentences by letting you refer back to previously mentioned actions:</p>

    <p><q>The researchers analyzed the data thoroughly. This analysis revealed unexpected patterns.</q></p>

    <p>Here, <q>analysis</q> refers to the analyzing just described, creating a smooth bridge between sentences.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Managing emphasis</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Placing a nominalization in subject position can foreground an action:</p>

    <p><q>The discovery of penicillin transformed medicine.</q></p>

    <p>The nominalization <q>discovery</q> emphasizes the finding itself, whereas <q>Fleming discovered penicillin, which transformed medicine</q> emphasizes Fleming.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Meeting genre expectations</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Academic and professional writing often favors nominalized style for its formal, objective tone. Scientific articles, legal documents, and policy reports frequently use constructions like <q>the elimination of variables</q> rather than <q>we eliminated variables.</q> Understanding this convention helps you adapt to different writing contexts.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>When Nominalization Weakens Writing</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Nominalization becomes problematic when it obscures meaning or adds unnecessary words:</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Burying the action</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Verbs carry energy; converting them to nouns diffuses that energy. <q>We decided</q> is more direct than <q>We reached a decision.</q></p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adding words</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Nominalizations often require support words—articles, prepositions, weak verbs like <q>make,</q> <q>give,</q> <q>conduct</q>:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Nominalized</cell>
        <cell>Verbal</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>make a recommendation</cell>
        <cell>recommend</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>give consideration to</cell>
        <cell>consider</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>conduct an investigation</cell>
        <cell>investigate</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Hiding agents</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Nominalization can obscure who performed an action. <q>Mistakes were made</q> (passive) becomes even more evasive as <q>The making of mistakes occurred.</q> If accountability matters, verbal forms with clear subjects are preferable.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Making Strategic Choices</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Neither "always use affixes" nor "always avoid nominalization" is good advice. The goal is intentional choice rather than unconscious habit.</p>

    <p>When revising, ask yourself:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Is the action important enough to be a verb? Core actions usually belong in verb form.</p></li>
      <li><p>Does the nominalization serve cohesion? Using a noun to refer back to a previous idea can strengthen flow.</p></li>
      <li><p>Is concision the priority? Affixed forms and verbal constructions are typically shorter.</p></li>
      <li><p>Does the longer form add useful emphasis or precision? Sometimes spelling things out has rhetorical value.</p></li>
      <li><p>What does my audience expect? Academic writing tolerates more nominalization than journalism or business communication.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Chapter 19 will return to nominalization as a revision strategy. For now, recognize that the morphemes you have learned are not merely analytical tools—they are choices that shape how your sentences read.</p>

      <title>Comparing Morphological Choices</title>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Instructions</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p>Read the two paragraphs below. Both describe the same situation, but each sentence makes different morphological choices—some use affixed forms (<q>reread,</q> <q>unfairly</q>) while others use descriptive phrases (<q>read again,</q> <q>in an unfair manner</q>). In Paragraph 2, every choice is swapped: what was an affix becomes a phrase, and vice versa.</p>

      <p>Neither paragraph is entirely better than the other. Each contains some choices that improve the writing and some that weaken it.</p>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Paragraph 1</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p><q>The hiring committee re-reviewed the applications after discovering that several candidates had been evaluated in an unfair manner. The lead reviewer, who had assessed the submissions carelessly at first, now worked with unusual diligence. Two applicants who had seemed underqualified actually possessed experience that the committee had failed to recognize previously. After reaching their decision, they resubmitted the recommendations to HR, confident that the process was now irreproachable.</q></p>

      <p><q>HR, however, responded unfavorably to the revised documentation. The department head believed the committee had misjudged several candidates and requested that they consider the selections again. The committee members, though initially not satisfied with this feedback, reviewed the criticisms thoughtfully. They discovered that certain qualifications had been overvalued while others had gone without notice. After rewriting their justifications with great care, they submitted the final version for a third time, which HR found unobjectionable.</q></p>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Paragraph 2</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p><q>The hiring committee reviewed the applications again after discovering that several candidates had been evaluated unfairly. The lead reviewer, who had assessed the submissions without care at first, now worked unusually diligently. Two applicants who had seemed insufficiently qualified actually possessed previously unrecognized experience. After deciding, they submitted the recommendations to HR again, confident that the process was now beyond reproach.</q></p>

      <p><q>HR, however, responded in an unfavorable manner to the revised documentation. The department head believed the committee had made misjudgments about several candidates and requested that they reconsider the selections. The committee members, though initially dissatisfied with this feedback, reviewed the criticisms in a thoughtful manner. They discovered that certain qualifications had been valued too highly while others had gone unnoticed. After writing their justifications again carefully, they resubmitted the final version, which HR found without objection.</q></p>

        <title>Exercises</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p>Exercise 20. Identify one position where Paragraph 1 makes the better choice. Quote both versions (from Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2), and explain why Paragraph 1's version is more effective. Consider factors like clarity, concision, and naturalness.</p>

      <p>Exercise 21. Identify one position where Paragraph 2 makes the better choice. Quote both versions, and explain why Paragraph 2's version is more effective.</p>

      <p>Exercise 22. Based on your analysis, write 2-3 sentences explaining what factors help you decide when to use an affixed form versus a descriptive phrase.</p>

      <p>Total estimated time: 50-60 minutes</p>
