    <title>Dialects and Language Varieties</title>

    <p>No language is monolithic. Every language exists in multiple varieties, used by different groups of speakers in different situations. These varieties are called <em>dialects</em>, and understanding them is essential for understanding how language works in society.</p>

    <p>A dialect is a version of a language associated with a particular region, social group, or community. The term can refer to varieties as small as &quot;Colorado Springs English&quot; or as broad as &quot;Caribbean Englishes.&quot; Everyone speaks a dialect—including people who speak what is called &quot;Standard American English.&quot; There is no dialect-free way of speaking a language.</p>

    <p>This point bears emphasizing: <em>you speak a dialect</em>. The prestige varieties that get called &quot;Standard English&quot; are themselves dialects—varieties associated with particular social groups (typically educated, middle- and upper-class speakers). They're not more &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; than other varieties; they're just more prestigious because of who speaks them.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Geographic Dialects</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The most familiar type of variation is geographic: speakers from different regions often speak differently. In the United States, speakers from Boston, New York, the South, and the Midwest have distinctive pronunciations, vocabulary, and grammatical features.</p>

    <p><em>Pronunciation differences:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Bostonians may drop the <foreign>r</foreign> in words like <foreign>car</foreign> (producing something like <foreign>cah</foreign>)</p></li>
      <li><p>New Yorkers may distinguish <foreign>caught</foreign> and <foreign>cot</foreign> while many Western Americans pronounce them identically</p></li>
      <li><p>Southerners often merge the vowels in <foreign>pin</foreign> and <foreign>pen</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Some regions preserve distinct vowels in <foreign>Mary</foreign>, <foreign>marry</foreign>, and <foreign>merry</foreign>; others collapse them all together</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Vocabulary differences:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Americans say <foreign>elevator</foreign> while the British say <foreign>lift</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>What's a <foreign>sub</foreign> in the Northeast is a <foreign>hoagie</foreign> in Philadelphia, a <foreign>grinder</foreign> in New England, a <foreign>hero</foreign> in New York, and a <foreign>po'boy</foreign> in Louisiana</p></li>
      <li><p>Southerners might say <foreign>y'all</foreign> while others say <foreign>you guys</foreign>, <foreign>you all</foreign>, or <foreign>yinz</foreign> (Pittsburgh)</p></li>
      <li><p>A <foreign>bubbler</foreign> is a drinking fountain in Wisconsin</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Grammatical differences:</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Some regions use <foreign>might could</foreign> or <foreign>used to could</foreign> (double modals)</p></li>
      <li><p>Scottish English has <foreign>I'll not</foreign> where other varieties have <foreign>I won't</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Many Southern varieties use <foreign>fixin' to</foreign> to mean <foreign>about to</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These differences emerge because communities that are geographically separated develop their language independently. Settlement patterns, migration routes, and geographic barriers all shape dialect boundaries.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Social and Ethnic Varieties</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Language also varies according to social factors like class, ethnicity, and community membership. Working-class speakers often use different forms than middle-class speakers; different ethnic communities may have distinctive varieties reflecting their history and culture.</p>

    <p><em>African American Vernacular English (AAVE)</em>, also called African American English or Black English, is a systematic variety with its own grammatical rules, developed from the historical experience of African Americans. It features constructions like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Habitual &quot;be&quot;</em>: <foreign>She be working</foreign> means she works regularly—a distinction Standard English can't make as concisely</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Aspectual &quot;been&quot;</em>: <foreign>I been known that</foreign> indicates something known for a long time, with emphasis</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Negative concord</em>: <foreign>I don't know nothing</foreign> uses multiple negatives for emphasis</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Copula deletion</em>: <foreign>She nice</foreign> omits <foreign>is</foreign> in exactly the contexts where Standard English can contract it</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Completive &quot;done&quot;</em>: <foreign>He done finished</foreign> emphasizes completion</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are not errors or &quot;bad grammar&quot;—they're rule-governed features of a particular variety, just as systematic as any features of Standard American English. Linguists have studied AAVE extensively and documented its complex, internally consistent grammar.</p>

    <p>Similarly, <em>Chicano English</em>, <em>Appalachian English</em>, <em>Indian English</em>, and other ethnic and regional varieties have their own systematic patterns. Each is internally logical and perfectly adequate for the communicative needs of its speakers.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Sociolinguistic Variables</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Sociolinguists study variation systematically by identifying <em>linguistic variables</em>—features that can be realized in different ways. For example, the variable <foreign>(ing)</foreign> can be realized as <q><foreign>-ing</foreign></q> or <q><foreign>-in'</foreign></q> (<foreign>walking</foreign> vs. <foreign>walkin'</foreign>). The variable <foreign>(th)</foreign> in <q><foreign>this</foreign></q> can be realized as a dental fricative <foreign>[ð]</foreign> or a stop <foreign>[d]</foreign> (<foreign>this</foreign> vs. <foreign>dis</foreign>).</p>

    <p>Research shows that the choice between variants isn't random—it correlates with social factors:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Social class</em>: Working-class speakers typically use more vernacular variants</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Formality</em>: The same speaker uses more standard variants in formal contexts</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Gender</em>: Some variants are associated more with women or men</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Age</em>: Some variants are spreading among younger speakers or disappearing among older ones</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Addressee</em>: Speakers accommodate toward the speech of their conversation partners</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This variation isn't chaotic—it's patterned and predictable. Sociolinguists can often predict what percentage of speakers from a given demographic group will use a particular variant in a particular context.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>All Dialects Are Linguistically Equal</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A fundamental principle of linguistics is that <em>all dialects are linguistically equal</em>. No dialect is inherently better, more logical, more expressive, or more sophisticated than any other. Each has a complete grammar; each can express anything its speakers need to express; each is learned perfectly by children who grow up hearing it.</p>

    <p>Consider some supposed &quot;problems&quot; with non-standard dialects:</p>

    <p><em>Claim</em>: &quot;Double negatives are illogical.&quot;</p>

    <p><em>Response</em>: Multiple negation is used in many languages (French, Spanish, Russian) without confusion. It's a systematic grammatical pattern for emphasis, not a logical error. Everyone understands <q><foreign>I don't want nothing</foreign></q>.</p>

    <p><em>Claim</em>: &quot;AAVE is just bad English with lazy pronunciation.&quot;</p>

    <p><em>Response</em>: AAVE has its own complex grammatical rules—some of which make distinctions Standard English can't. Habitual <q><foreign>be</foreign></q> expresses aspect more precisely than Standard English can. That's not laziness; that's linguistic sophistication.</p>

    <p><em>Claim</em>: &quot;Some dialects are more suited for abstract thought or literature.&quot;</p>

    <p><em>Response</em>: Any language or dialect can express any concept. If a word or construction doesn't exist, speakers coin one. Some of the most celebrated American literature uses non-standard dialects: Mark Twain's <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (Twain, 1884), Zora Neale Hurston's <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> (Hurston, 1937), and Toni Morrison's entire oeuvre.</p>

    <p>The differences between dialects are differences of <em>social prestige</em>, not linguistic quality. When people say that one dialect is &quot;better&quot; than another, they're really making a social judgment about the people who speak it. The dialect spoken by socially powerful groups becomes the &quot;standard,&quot; and other dialects become &quot;nonstandard&quot;—but this distinction reflects social hierarchy, not linguistic fact.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Standard Language Ideology</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The belief that one variety of a language is inherently superior—usually the one associated with education, wealth, and power—is sometimes called the <em>standard language ideology</em>. This ideology is so pervasive that most people accept it without question. But it's worth examining critically.</p>

    <p>Standard varieties are useful. They provide a common code for communication across dialect boundaries, a stable written form, and shared conventions for formal contexts. But treating the standard as the only &quot;correct&quot; form has costs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>It stigmatizes millions of speakers as &quot;deficient&quot; for speaking perfectly good varieties</p></li>
      <li><p>It creates linguistic insecurity that can impede learning</p></li>
      <li><p>It erases the rich grammatical complexity of non-standard varieties</p></li>
      <li><p>It reinforces social inequalities by privileging those who already speak the prestige variety</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This doesn't mean all language choices are equally appropriate in all situations. Standard American English is expected in many formal and institutional contexts, and using a nonstandard dialect in those contexts can have social consequences. But understanding that these are social conventions—not linguistic necessities—is the first step toward thinking critically about language and fairness.</p>

    <title>Speech and Discourse Communities</title>

    <p>Linguists use two related but distinct concepts to describe how people use language in social groups: speech communities and discourse communities. Understanding both helps explain how language both reflects and creates social belonging.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Speech Communities</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A <em>speech community</em> is a group of people who share linguistic norms and expectations. Membership in a speech community is usually based on shared culture, identity, or geographic proximity. The term emphasizes spoken language and the social bonds that shared language creates.</p>

    <p>Speech communities are defined not just by what people speak, but by shared attitudes about language—what counts as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; speech, what variants are appropriate in what contexts, how language indexes social meaning.</p>

    <p>Speech communities can overlap and nest within each other. You might belong to the speech community of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>English speakers</p></li>
      <li><p>American English speakers</p></li>
      <li><p>Southern American English speakers</p></li>
      <li><p>Atlanta English speakers</p></li>
      <li><p>Your particular neighborhood or social network</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each level has its own norms. You might share vocabulary with all English speakers but share particular pronunciations only with Atlantans, and share particular slang only with your immediate friend group.</p>

    <p>Membership in a speech community is often connected to identity. The way you speak marks you as a member of particular groups and distinguishes you from members of other groups. Language can signal where you're from, who your people are, and where you belong.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Discourse Communities</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A <em>discourse community</em> is a group of people who share ways of using language for particular purposes, especially in writing. Membership is usually based on shared activities, goals, or expertise rather than cultural background. Academic disciplines, professional fields, and hobby groups all form discourse communities.</p>

    <p>Discourse communities have their own:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Genres</em>: The types of texts they produce (research articles, legal briefs, fan fiction)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Vocabulary</em>: Technical terms and jargon specific to the community</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Conventions</em>: Expectations about structure, style, and citation</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Values</em>: What counts as good evidence, effective argument, successful communication</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Scientists write research articles with abstracts, methods sections, and citations; lawyers write briefs with particular structures and terminology; gamers have their own vocabulary for discussing strategies. Learning to participate in a discourse community means learning its language practices.</p>

    <p>Unlike speech communities, discourse communities are typically joined voluntarily and through explicit learning. No one is born into the discourse community of lawyers or biochemists; people enter through education and apprenticeship. This can make discourse communities both more open (anyone can join who's willing to learn) and more exclusive (mastery takes time and effort, often requires institutional access).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Code-Switching</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Most people belong to multiple speech and discourse communities and adjust their language depending on context. This adjustment is called <em>code-switching</em>: shifting between different languages, dialects, or registers depending on the situation.</p>

    <p>Code-switching can happen:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Between languages</em>: A bilingual speaker might use English at work and Spanish at home</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Between dialects</em>: A speaker might use AAVE with family and Standard English in job interviews</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Between registers</em>: A lawyer might use legal jargon with colleagues and plain language with clients</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Code-switching is a sign of linguistic competence, not confusion. A speaker who uses AAVE with friends and family but Standard American English in job interviews is demonstrating mastery of two varieties and sensitivity to social context. They're not &quot;unable&quot; to speak &quot;correctly&quot;—they're strategically deploying different codes for different purposes.</p>

    <p>Code-switching allows people to signal identity and solidarity in some contexts while meeting institutional expectations in others. It's socially sophisticated behavior that requires knowing two (or more) systems and knowing when to use each one.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Performance and Identity</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Language isn't just about communicating information—it's about performing identity. Every time you speak, you're not just saying something; you're presenting yourself as a particular kind of person.</p>

    <p>Consider how different speech styles project different identities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Speaking very formally might project authority, expertise, or distance</p></li>
      <li><p>Using slang might project youth, casualness, or in-group membership</p></li>
      <li><p>Adopting a regional accent might project local identity or authenticity</p></li>
      <li><p>Code-switching might project multicultural sophistication or community connection</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>People actively construct their identities through language choices. A teenager might adopt certain slang specifically to identify with a peer group. A professional might consciously adopt formal speech patterns to be taken seriously. A returning immigrant might maintain heritage language features to stay connected to roots.</p>

    <p>This doesn't mean language use is always conscious or strategic. Much of it is automatic and habitual. But it does mean that language and identity are deeply intertwined—and that judgments about how people speak are often, implicitly, judgments about who they are.</p>

  <section xml:id="ch-03-language-varieties-sec-33">
    <title>Language Change and Attitudes</title>

    <p>Language is always changing. New words enter the vocabulary, pronunciations shift, grammatical patterns evolve. This change is natural, inevitable, and—from a linguistic perspective—neither good nor bad. It's just what happens when living communities use language over time.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Universality of Change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Every living language changes. Every. Single. One. There are no exceptions.</p>

    <p>We can observe this by comparing historical stages of English:</p>

    <p><em>Old English (c. 450-1100)</em>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><foreign>Hwæt! We Gardena in geardagum, þeodcyninga, þrym gefrunon...</foreign></p>
      <p>(<em>Beowulf</em>, c. 1000)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Middle English (c. 1100-1500)</em>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><foreign>Whan that Aprille with his shoures soote / The droghte of March hath perced to the roote...</foreign></p>
      <p>(Chaucer, c. 1400)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Early Modern English (c. 1500-1700)</em>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><foreign>To be, or not to be: that is the question.</foreign></p>
      <p>(Shakespeare, 1603)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><em>Modern English</em>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This sentence is immediately comprehensible.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Each stage differs dramatically from the others. Old English is completely foreign to modern readers—it requires translation. Middle English is partially comprehensible with effort. Early Modern English is mostly accessible but noticeably different. The language never stopped changing; we just notice older changes less because we learned the results.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Mechanisms of Change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Sound change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Sound change alters pronunciation systematically. The &quot;Great Vowel Shift&quot; (roughly 1400-1700) transformed English vowels: <q><foreign>house</foreign></q> was once pronounced like <q><foreign>hoose</foreign></q>, <q><foreign>name</foreign></q> like <q><foreign>nahm</foreign></q>. More recently, many American dialects have undergone vowel shifts that linguists are still documenting.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Grammatical change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Grammatical change alters morphology and syntax. English has lost most of its case endings (Old English had four cases, like German; Modern English only preserves case in pronouns). Word order has become more fixed as inflectional endings disappeared. New constructions emerge: the progressive (<q><foreign>I am going</foreign></q>) expanded dramatically in Modern English.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Lexical change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Lexical change adds, removes, and shifts words. New words enter through:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Coining</em>: <foreign>blog</foreign>, <foreign>selfie</foreign>, <foreign>doomscrolling</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Borrowing</em>: <foreign>sushi</foreign>, <foreign>yoga</foreign>, <foreign>algorithm</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Compounding</em>: <foreign>smartphone</foreign>, <foreign>cybersecurity</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><em>Derivation</em>: <foreign>unfriend</foreign>, <foreign>mansplain</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Old words become obsolete (<foreign>forsooth</foreign>, <foreign>prithee</foreign>) or shift meaning (<foreign>awful</foreign> once meant &quot;inspiring awe&quot;; <foreign>nice</foreign> once meant &quot;foolish&quot;; <foreign>silly</foreign> once meant &quot;blessed&quot;).</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Semantic change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Semantic change shifts meanings. <q><foreign>Decimate</foreign></q> originally meant &quot;kill one in ten&quot;; now it means &quot;devastate.&quot; <q><foreign>Literally</foreign></q> is increasingly used for emphasis rather than literal meaning. Such shifts are as old as language itself.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why People Resist Change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>If change is natural and universal, why do people resist it so strongly?</p>

    <p><em>Nostalgia</em>: People associate earlier stages of language with their youth or with respected figures from the past. The language of our grandparents sounds more &quot;proper&quot; because we associate it with authority.</p>

    <p><em>Social markers</em>: As discussed above, language features can mark social identity. Resisting change is often about resisting the social changes that new language represents. Objections to singular <q><foreign>they</foreign></q> are often really about discomfort with changing gender norms.</p>

    <p><em>Loss aversion</em>: People notice what seems to be lost (distinctions, words, &quot;rules&quot;) more than what's gained. We don't celebrate new expressive resources as readily as we mourn &quot;declining standards.&quot;</p>

    <p><em>Education and investment</em>: People who learned prescriptive rules have invested effort in mastering them. It's uncomfortable to learn that those rules might be arbitrary or changing.</p>

    <p><em>Genuine confusion</em>: Occasionally, new usages do create temporary ambiguity. But languages develop ways to resolve ambiguity; if a change persists despite creating confusion, the confusion usually wasn't actually that serious.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Embracing Change</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>From a descriptive perspective, change is neither good nor bad. Old forms aren't better than new ones; they're just older. Efforts to freeze language in some imagined perfect state are doomed to fail, and they reflect a misunderstanding of what language is.</p>

    <p>Language belongs to its speakers, and it will continue to evolve as they use it. The &quot;errors&quot; that horrify prescriptivists today are often the standard forms of tomorrow. Shakespeare used <q><foreign>you</foreign></q> as a singular (replacing <q><foreign>thou</foreign></q>); we don't consider that an error. Chaucer used double negatives; we don't consider <em>him</em> uneducated.</p>

    <p>What can you do with this knowledge?</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Notice your own reactions to unfamiliar language—are they linguistic or social?</p></li>
      <li><p>Distinguish between genuine confusion and mere unfamiliarity</p></li>
      <li><p>Recognize that your own &quot;standard&quot; language was once innovative</p></li>
      <li><p>Appreciate the creativity that drives language change</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Language and Social Power</title>

    <p>Language variation is never just about language. It's always about power: who has it, who doesn't, and how language is used to maintain or challenge those arrangements.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Prestige Dialects and Linguistic Discrimination</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some dialects carry social prestige; others are stigmatized. Typically, the prestige varieties are those spoken by socially dominant groups—the wealthy, the educated, the politically powerful. These varieties become the &quot;standard,&quot; taught in schools, used in media, and expected in professional contexts.</p>

    <p>Speakers of stigmatized varieties face <em>linguistic discrimination</em> (also called <em>linguicism</em>). They may be judged as unintelligent, uneducated, or incompetent based purely on how they speak—not on what they say or how well they reason.</p>

    <p>Research consistently documents this discrimination:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>In matched-guise experiments, the same speaker using different accents is rated differently on traits like intelligence and trustworthiness</p></li>
      <li><p>Job applicants with non-standard accents receive fewer callbacks</p></li>
      <li><p>Students who speak stigmatized varieties may be tracked into lower academic paths</p></li>
      <li><p>Speakers of non-standard varieties often experience linguistic insecurity and may be reluctant to participate in formal contexts</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This discrimination is particularly insidious because it often goes unrecognized. People believe they're making objective judgments about quality when they're really responding to social associations. And because language is learned in early childhood and tied to identity, asking people to change how they speak means asking them to distance themselves from their community.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Language and Institutional Power</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Language discrimination operates through institutions as well as individual attitudes.</p>

    <p><em>Education</em>: Schools typically privilege Standard English and may actively discourage or correct other varieties. Students who arrive speaking non-standard dialects face a hidden curriculum: they must learn not just content but a new way of speaking. This disadvantages children from non-standard-speaking communities while children from standard-speaking families arrive &quot;already knowing&quot; what school expects.</p>

    <p><em>Employment</em>: Many workplaces have explicit or implicit language requirements that exclude non-standard speakers. Judgments about &quot;professional communication&quot; often encode preferences for prestige varieties. An accent or dialect can affect hiring, promotion, and advancement.</p>

    <p><em>Legal system</em>: Court proceedings expect Standard English. Speakers of other varieties may be misunderstood, may have their speech transcribed incorrectly, and may be judged less credible.</p>

    <p><em>Media</em>: News broadcasts, formal publications, and prestigious outlets typically use prestige varieties. Other varieties are relegated to entertainment, comedy, or stereotyped representation.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Colonial and Historical Influences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Many prestige judgments have roots in colonialism and historical oppression.</p>

    <p>Standard American English reflects the language of British colonizers and their descendants. The stigmatization of AAVE reflects the history of slavery and racial discrimination. The privileging of European languages over indigenous ones reflects colonial conquest. English itself became a global language not because of inherent superiority but because of British colonial power and later American economic dominance.</p>

    <p>These historical processes are important for understanding why certain varieties are stigmatized today. The judgments feel natural and inevitable, but they're the product of particular histories of power and domination.</p>

    <p><em>Linguistic imperialism</em> refers to the dominance of certain languages (especially English) in international contexts, which can marginalize speakers of other languages and drive language shift or death.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Moving Toward Linguistic Justice</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Recognizing the relationship between language and power doesn't mean abandoning standards or pretending that all varieties will be received equally in all contexts. It means being honest about how linguistic judgments work and being thoughtful about how we respond.</p>

    <p><em>Inclusive approaches</em> to language diversity involve several principles:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>Respect the varieties that speakers bring with them.</em> Don't treat children's home languages as problems to be fixed. Acknowledge the grammatical sophistication of all varieties.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Teach standard varieties as additions rather than replacements.</em> Students can expand their repertoires without abandoning their home languages. The goal is bidialectalism, not replacement.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Make standard varieties accessible to all students.</em> Don't assume that students already know what's expected in formal contexts. Make implicit norms explicit.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Be explicit about when and why particular varieties are expected.</em> Help students understand the social dynamics of language rather than just enforcing rules.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Challenge discrimination based on language.</em> Notice when judgments about competence or intelligence are really responses to accent or dialect. Push back against linguistic bias in hiring, education, and public discourse.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For writers and speakers, this understanding enables more critical engagement with grammatical advice. You can follow conventions when they serve your purposes, while recognizing that the conventions are social constructions, not natural laws. You can make informed choices about how to present yourself linguistically, rather than assuming that there's only one right way to write or speak.</p>

      <title>Part A: Mapping Your Linguistic World</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 1. Speech Communities</em>: List at least <em>three speech communities</em> you belong to (these could be based on region, ethnicity, family, friend groups, etc.). For each, identify one distinctive feature of how language is used in that community (vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, or attitudes about language).</p>

    <p><em>Question 2. Discourse Communities</em>: List at least <em>two discourse communities</em> you currently belong to or are trying to enter (academic disciplines, professional fields, hobby groups, online communities). For each, identify:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What genres or types of texts does this community produce?</p></li>
      <li><p>What specialized vocabulary or jargon does it use?</p></li>
      <li><p>How did you learn (or how are you learning) to participate in this community's language practices?</p></li>
    </ul>

      <title>Part B: Code-Switching in Your Life</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 3.</em> Describe a specific situation where you code-switch—where you consciously or unconsciously adjust your language depending on context. This could be switching between languages, dialects, or registers. Address:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What triggers the switch? (audience, setting, topic, purpose)</p></li>
      <li><p>What specific features change? (vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, tone)</p></li>
      <li><p>How does it feel to make this switch? Is it effortless, strategic, uncomfortable?</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Question 4.</em> The chapter discusses <em>linguistic discrimination</em>—being judged negatively based on how you speak. Have you ever experienced this, witnessed it, or found yourself making such judgments about others? Reflect on this experience in light of what you've learned about dialect equality.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Part C: Looking Ahead</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 5.</em> Think about a career or professional field you're interested in. What language expectations do you anticipate in that field? What "discourse community" would you need to join? What aspects of professional communication in that field seem like genuine requirements for clarity and effectiveness, and what aspects might be arbitrary conventions or gatekeeping?</p>
