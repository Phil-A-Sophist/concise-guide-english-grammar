    <title>Sentence Types Overview</title>

    <p>English sentences can be classified by structure:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Type</cell>
        <cell>Structure</cell>
        <cell>Example</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Simple</cell>
        <cell>One independent clause</cell>
        <cell><foreign>The dog barked.</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Compound</cell>
        <cell>Two+ independent clauses</cell>
        <cell><foreign>The dog barked, and the cat hid.</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Complex</cell>
        <cell>One independent + one+ dependent clause</cell>
        <cell><foreign>The dog barked when the mail arrived.</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>

        <cell><foreign>The dog barked when the mail arrived, and the cat hid under the bed.</foreign></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p>Understanding these structures allows you to vary your prose and convey relationships between ideas effectively.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-92">
    <title>Simple Sentences</title>

    <p>A <term>simple sentence</term> contains one independent clause—a subject-predicate unit that expresses a complete thought.</p>

    <p><q><foreign>The students studied.</foreign></q></p>

    <p><q><foreign>My neighbor's talented daughter won the competition last week.</foreign></q></p>

    <p>Simple sentences can be long if they have compound subjects, compound predicates, or extensive modification:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Compound subject: <q><foreign>Marcus <em>and</em> Elena traveled to Spain.</foreign></q> (still simple—one predicate)</p></li>
      <li><p>Compound predicate: <foreign>The dog <em>barked</em> and <em>chased</em> the squirrel.</foreign> (still simple—one subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>Heavy modification: <foreign>The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya collapsed at the finish line.</foreign> (still simple—one clause)</p></li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-93">
    <title>Compound Sentences</title>

    <p>A <term>compound sentence</term> contains two or more <em>independent clauses</em> joined through coordination. Each clause could stand alone, but coordination shows the ideas are related.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Creating Compound Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Independent clauses can be joined by:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Coordinating conjunction (with comma): <foreign>The power went out, and we lit candles.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Semicolon: <foreign>The power went out; we lit candles.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p>Semicolon + conjunctive adverb: <foreign>The power went out; therefore, we lit candles.</foreign></p></li>
    </ol>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The acronym FANBOYS helps you remember the seven coordinating conjunctions:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Conjunction</cell>
        <cell>Relationship</cell>

        <cell>result/effect</cell>
        <cell><foreign>The restaurant was packed, so we ordered takeout.</foreign></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Punctuation rule</em>: Place a comma before the conjunction when it joins two independent clauses:</p>

    <p><q><foreign>The lecture was fascinating<em>,</em> and I took detailed notes.</foreign></q></p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Conjunctive Adverbs</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Conjunctive adverbs</term> offer another way to connect independent clauses with more explicit relationships:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Relationship</cell>
        <cell>Examples</cell>
      </row>

        <cell><foreign>moreover, furthermore, additionally, also</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Contrast</cell>
        <cell><foreign>however, nevertheless, nonetheless, instead</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Result</cell>
        <cell><foreign>therefore, thus, consequently, hence</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Time</cell>
        <cell><foreign>meanwhile, subsequently, afterward, then</foreign></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Example</cell>
        <cell><foreign>for example, for instance, specifically</foreign></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Punctuation</em>: Use a semicolon before and comma after the conjunctive adverb:</p>

    <p><q><foreign>The experiment failed<em>;</em> however<em>,</em> we learned from the results.</foreign></q></p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Compound vs. Compound Elements</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Don't confuse compound sentences with simple sentences containing compound elements:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Structure</cell>
        <cell>Example</cell>
        <cell>Type</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Compound subject</cell>
        <cell><foreign>Marcus and Elena traveled.</foreign></cell>
        <cell>Simple (one VP)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Compound predicate</cell>
        <cell><foreign>The dog barked and chased the squirrel.</foreign></cell>
        <cell>Simple (one subject)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Compound sentence</cell>
        <cell><foreign>Marcus traveled, and Elena stayed.</foreign></cell>
        <cell>Compound (two clauses)</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Test</em>: Does each side of the conjunction have its own subject? If yes → compound sentence.</p>


  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-94">
    <title>Complex Sentences</title>

    <p>A <term>complex sentence</term> contains one independent clause and at least one <term>dependent (subordinate) clause</term>. Unlike compound sentences, complex sentences create a hierarchy—one idea is primary, another is supporting.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Independent vs. Dependent Clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>An <term>independent clause</term> expresses a complete thought:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>The power flickered.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>Everyone looked up.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <term>dependent clause</term> has a subject and predicate but cannot stand alone:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>When the power flickered</foreign> (What happened?)</p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>That everyone noticed</foreign> (What about it?)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The subordinating word (<foreign>when, that, because, who</foreign>) transforms an independent clause into a dependent one.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Creating Complex Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><q><foreign>Everyone looked up <em>when the power flickered</em>.</foreign></q></p>

    <p><q><foreign>The fact <em>that everyone noticed</em> surprised the speaker.</foreign></q></p>

    <p>The dependent clause provides context, explanation, or specification for the main clause.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why Use Complex Sentences?</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Show relationships: Causal, temporal, and conditional connections become explicit</p></li>
      <li><p>Emphasize main ideas: Subordinating less important information guides readers</p></li>
      <li><p>Create sophisticated prose: Varied structures make writing more engaging</p></li>
    </ul>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-95">
    <title>Types of Dependent Clauses</title>

    <p>Dependent clauses are classified by their grammatical function.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adverb Clauses (Adverbial Clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Adverb clauses</term> modify verbs, adjectives, or sentences, answering questions like when?, why?, under what conditions?</p>

    <p><em>Time</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>We celebrated <em>when the results came in</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>After the concert ended</em>, the crowd dispersed.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Reason</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>She declined <em>because she had other plans</em>.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Since you asked</em>, I'll explain.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Contrast</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>Although the evidence was strong</em>, the jury was skeptical.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>The project succeeded <em>even though we faced obstacles</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Condition</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign><em>If the weather improves</em>, we'll go hiking.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>I won't sign <em>unless you modify the contract</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Relative Clauses (Adjective Clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Relative clauses</term> modify nouns, specifying which person, thing, or place is meant. They're introduced by relative pronouns (<foreign>who, whom, which, that, whose</foreign>) or relative adverbs (<foreign>where, when, why</foreign>).</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><foreign>The candidate <em>who impressed the committee</em> received the position.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>The novel <em>that won the award</em> explores identity.</foreign></p></li>
      <li><p><foreign>This is the park <em>where we first met</em>.</foreign></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Restrictive vs. Non-restrictive</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Restrictive</em> (essential): <foreign>The students <em>who studied</em> passed.</foreign> (specifies which students)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Non-restrictive</em> (additional info): <foreign>My sister, <em>who lives in Boston</em>, visited.</foreign> (adds information about the only sister)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Non-restrictive clauses are set off with commas.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Noun Clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><term>Noun clauses</term> function as noun phrases—subjects, objects, or complements. They're introduced by <foreign>that</foreign>, <foreign>whether</foreign>, <foreign>if</foreign>, or wh-words.</p>

    <p><em>As subject</em>: <foreign><em>That she resigned</em> shocked the board.</foreign></p>

    <p><em>As direct object</em>: <foreign>I understand <em>that you're frustrated</em>.</foreign></p>

    <p><em>As complement</em>: <foreign>The problem is <em>that we underestimated demand</em>.</foreign></p>

      <p>Answer the following questions about coordination and subordination.</p>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Exercises</title>
      </paragraphs>

      <p><em>Exercise 16.</em> The following sentence uses coordination:</p>

      <p><foreign>The experiment failed, and the researchers were disappointed.</foreign></p>

      <p>a) Rewrite this sentence using subordination to emphasize the researchers' disappointment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>b) Rewrite it using subordination to emphasize that the experiment failed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>c) Which version (coordination or subordination) would you choose if you wanted to present both ideas as equally important? Explain.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Exercise 17.</em> Read the following passage and answer the questions:</p>

      <p><foreign>When the storm began, the hikers sought shelter. They found a small cave, and they waited there for hours. Although they were cold and hungry, they remained calm because they had prepared for emergencies.</foreign></p>

      <p>a) Identify all independent and dependent clauses in the passage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Independent clauses: _______</p></li>
        <li><p>Dependent clauses (and their types): _______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>b) How many sentences are in this passage, and what type is each?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Exercise 18.</em> In 3-4 sentences, explain when a writer should choose coordination over subordination (or vice versa). What effect does each choice have on emphasis and the relationship between ideas? Provide an example to illustrate your point.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>
