    <title>Sentence Types Overview</title>

    <p>English sentences can be classified by structure:</p>

    <title>Simple Sentences</title>

    <p>A <em>simple sentence</em> contains one independent clause—a subject-predicate unit that expresses a complete thought.</p>

    <p><em>The students studied.</em></p>

    <p><em>My neighbor's talented daughter won the competition last week.</em></p>

    <p>Simple sentences can be long if they have compound subjects, compound predicates, or extensive modification:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Compound subject: "Marcus <em>and</em> Elena traveled to Spain." (still simple—one predicate)</p></li>
      <li><p>Compound predicate: <em>The dog <em>barked</em> and <em>chased</em> the squirrel.</em> (still simple—one subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>Heavy modification: <em>The exhausted marathon runner from Kenya collapsed at the finish line.</em> (still simple—one clause)</p></li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-93">
    <title>Compound Sentences</title>

    <p>A <em>compound sentence</em> contains two or more <em>independent clauses</em> joined through coordination. Each clause could stand alone, but coordination shows the ideas are related.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Creating Compound Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Independent clauses can be joined by:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p><em>Coordinating conjunction</em> (with comma): <em>The power went out, and we lit candles.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Semicolon: <em>The power went out; we lit candles.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Semicolon + conjunctive adverb: <em>The power went out; therefore, we lit candles.</em></p></li>
    </ol>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The acronym <em>FANBOYS</em> helps you remember the seven coordinating conjunctions:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">

        <cell>result/effect</cell>
        <cell>"The restaurant was packed, so we ordered takeout."</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Punctuation rule</em>: Place a <em>comma before</em> the conjunction when it joins two independent clauses:</p>

    <p>"The lecture was fascinating<em>,</em> and I took detailed notes."</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Conjunctive Adverbs</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Conjunctive adverbs</em> offer another way to connect independent clauses with more explicit relationships:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Relationship</cell>
        <cell>Examples</cell>
      </row>

        <cell>Addition</cell>
        <cell>moreover, furthermore, additionally, also</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Contrast</cell>
        <cell>however, nevertheless, nonetheless, instead</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Result</cell>
        <cell>therefore, thus, consequently, hence</cell>

        <cell>meanwhile, subsequently, afterward, then</cell>
      </row>

        <cell>Example</cell>
        <cell>for example, for instance, specifically</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Punctuation</em>: Use a <em>semicolon before</em> and <em>comma after</em> the conjunctive adverb:</p>

    <p><em>The experiment failed<em>;</em> however<em>,</em> we learned from the results.</em></p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Compound vs. Compound Elements</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Don't confuse compound sentences with simple sentences containing compound elements:</p>

    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>Structure</cell>
        <cell>Example</cell>
        <cell>Type</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Compound subject</cell>
        <cell>"Marcus and Elena traveled."</cell>
        <cell>Simple (one VP)</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>Compound predicate</cell>
        <cell>"The dog barked and chased the squirrel."</cell>
        <cell>Simple (one subject)</cell>

        <cell>"Marcus traveled, and Elena stayed."</cell>
        <cell>Compound (two clauses)</cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>

    <p><em>Test</em>: Does each side of the conjunction have its own subject? If yes → compound sentence.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-94">
    <title>Complex Sentences</title>

    <p>A <em>complex sentence</em> contains one independent clause and at least one <em>dependent (subordinate) clause</em>. Unlike compound sentences, complex sentences create a hierarchy—one idea is primary, another is supporting.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Independent vs. Dependent Clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>An <em>independent clause</em> expresses a complete thought:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The power flickered.</p></li>
      <li><p>Everyone looked up.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <em>dependent clause</em> has a subject and predicate but cannot stand alone:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>When the power flickered (What happened?)</p></li>
      <li><p>That everyone noticed (What about it?)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The subordinating word (when, that, because, who) transforms an independent clause into a dependent one.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Creating Complex Sentences</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>"Everyone looked up <em>when the power flickered</em>."</p>

    <p>"The fact <em>that everyone noticed</em> surprised the speaker."</p>

    <p>The dependent clause provides context, explanation, or specification for the main clause.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Why Use Complex Sentences?</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Show relationships: Causal, temporal, and conditional connections become explicit</p></li>
      <li><p>Emphasize main ideas: Subordinating less important information guides readers</p></li>
      <li><p>Create sophisticated prose: Varied structures make writing more engaging</p></li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-95">
    <title>Types of Dependent Clauses</title>

    <p>Dependent clauses are classified by their grammatical function.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Adverb Clauses (Adverbial Clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Adverb clauses</em> modify verbs, adjectives, or sentences, answering questions like when?, why?, under what conditions?</p>

    <p><em>Time</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"We celebrated <em>when the results came in</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>After the concert ended</em>, the crowd dispersed.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Reason</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"She declined <em>because she had other plans</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>Since you asked</em>, I'll explain.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Contrast</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em><em>Although the evidence was strong</em>, the jury was skeptical.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>"The project succeeded <em>even though we faced obstacles</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Condition</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em><em>If the weather improves</em>, we'll go hiking.</em></p></li>
      <li><p>"I won't sign <em>unless you modify the contract</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Relative Clauses (Adjective Clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Relative clauses</em> modify nouns, specifying which person, thing, or place is meant. They're introduced by relative pronouns (who, whom, which, that, whose) or relative adverbs (where, when, why).</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"The candidate <em>who impressed the committee</em> received the position."</p></li>
      <li><p>"The novel <em>that won the award</em> explores identity."</p></li>
      <li><p>"This is the park <em>where we first met</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Restrictive vs. Non-restrictive</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Restrictive</em> (essential): "The students <em>who studied</em> passed." (specifies which students)</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Non-restrictive</em> (additional info): "My sister, <em>who lives in Boston</em>, visited." (adds information about the only sister)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Non-restrictive clauses are set off with commas.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Noun Clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Noun clauses</em> function as noun phrases—subjects, objects, or complements. They're introduced by that, whether, if, or wh-words.</p>

    <p><em>As subject</em>: That she resigned shocked the board.</p>

    <p><em>As direct object</em>: "I understand <em>that you're frustrated</em>."</p>

    <p><em>As complement</em>: "The problem is <em>that we underestimated demand</em>."</p>

  <section xml:id="ch-09-compound-and-complex-sentences-sec-96">
    <title>Subordinating Conjunctions</title>

    <p><em>Subordinating conjunctions</em> introduce adverb clauses and specify relationships:</p>

    <subsection xml:id="ch-09-homework-part1">
      <title>Part 1: Sentence Type Identification</title>

      <p><em>Instructions:</em> For each sentence, identify the sentence type (simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex) and identify all clauses. Label each clause as independent (IC) or dependent (DC).</p>

      <p><em>Example (completed):</em></p>

      <p><em>Sentence:</em> <em>Although the weather was terrible, the athletes competed fiercely, and the crowd cheered enthusiastically.</em></p>

      <p>Sentence type: Compound-complex</p>

      <p>Clauses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Although the weather was terrible — DC (adverb clause)</p></li>
        <li><p>the athletes competed fiercely — IC</p></li>
        <li><p>the crowd cheered enthusiastically — IC</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Exercises:</em></p>

      <p>1. <em>The professor who taught my linguistics class has retired, but she still occasionally gives guest lectures.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Sentence type: _______</p></li>
        <li><p>Clauses (identify each as IC or DC and classify any dependent clauses by type): _______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>2. <em>Because the deadline was extended, I had time to revise my paper thoroughly.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Sentence type: _______</p></li>

        <li><p>Clauses: _______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>4. Identify the dependent clause in each sentence and classify it as an adverb clause, relative clause, or noun clause:</p>

      <p>a) <em>The candidate who impressed the committee received the position.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Dependent clause: _______</p></li>
        <li><p>Type: _______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <title>Part 5: Analysis and Reflection</title>

      <p><em>Instructions:</em> Answer the following questions about coordination and subordination.</p>

      <p><em>Exercises:</em></p>

      <p>16. The following sentence uses coordination:</p>

      <p><em>The experiment failed, and the researchers were disappointed.</em></p>

      <p>a) Rewrite this sentence using subordination to emphasize the researchers' disappointment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>b) Rewrite it using subordination to emphasize that the experiment failed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>c) Which version (coordination or subordination) would you choose if you wanted to present both ideas as equally important? Explain.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>17. Read the following passage and answer the questions:</p>

      <p><em>When the storm began, the hikers sought shelter. They found a small cave, and they waited there for hours. Although they were cold and hungry, they remained calm because they had prepared for emergencies.</em></p>

      <p>a) Identify all independent and dependent clauses in the passage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Independent clauses: _______</p></li>
        <li><p>Dependent clauses (and their types): _______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>b) How many sentences are in this passage, and what type is each?</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>18. In 3-4 sentences, explain when a writer should choose coordination over subordination (or vice versa). What effect does each choice have on emphasis and the relationship between ideas? Provide an example to illustrate your point.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>_______</p></li>
      </ul>
