    <title>Nouns vs. Nominals: Form vs. Function</title>

    <p>Understanding the distinction between <em>nouns</em> (a form/part of speech) and <em>nominals</em> (a function) is essential for accurate grammatical analysis.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Noun as Form</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A <em>noun</em> is a part of speech—a word class with particular morphological and syntactic characteristics (Chapter 5). Nouns can be pluralized, possess, follow determiners, and serve as subjects/objects.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>book, happiness, Maria, government</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Nominal as Function</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>A <em>nominal</em> is any word, phrase, or clause that <em>functions</em> in a position typically occupied by a noun phrase—as subject, object, or complement.</p>

    <p><em>Key insight</em>: All nouns functioning as subjects/objects are nominals, but not all nominals are nouns.</p>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-14-nominals-sec-142">
    <title>Structures That Function as Nominals</title>

    <p>Many different structures can serve the nominal function.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>1. Noun Phrases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>The prototypical nominal is a noun phrase:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The book is on the table. (subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I read <em>the interesting book</em>." (object)</p></li>
      <li><p>"This is <em>my sister</em>." (subject complement)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>2. Pronouns</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Pronouns replace entire noun phrases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>She arrived early. (subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I saw <em>them</em>." (object)</p></li>
      <li><p>"The winner is <em>he</em>." (complement, formal)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>3. Noun Clauses (That-clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Clauses introduced by <em>that</em> function as nominals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>That she resigned surprised everyone. (subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I believe <em>that she is honest</em>." (object)</p></li>
      <li><p>"The problem is <em>that we're out of time</em>." (complement)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>4. Noun Clauses (Wh-clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Clauses introduced by wh-words function as nominals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What she said was important. (subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I don't know <em>where he went</em>." (object)</p></li>
      <li><p>"The question is <em>who will lead</em>." (complement)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>5. Gerund Phrases</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>-ing</em> forms of verbs (gerunds) head phrases that function as nominals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Swimming is good exercise. (subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>"She enjoys <em>reading novels</em>." (object)</p></li>
      <li><p>"His hobby is <em>collecting stamps</em>." (complement)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>6. Infinitive Phrases (Nominal)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Infinitive phrases (to + verb) can function as nominals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>To err is human. (subject)</p></li>
      <li><p>"She wants <em>to succeed</em>." (object)</p></li>
      <li><p>"The goal is <em>to finish on time</em>." (complement)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>7. Nominalized Adjectives</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some adjectives, with a determiner, function nominally (referring to a group):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The poor need assistance.</p></li>
      <li><p>The rich have advantages.</p></li>
      <li><p>The accused denied the charges.</p></li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section xml:id="ch-14-nominals-sec-143">
    <title>Noun Clauses in Detail</title>

    <p><em>Noun clauses</em> are dependent clauses that function as nominals—as subjects, objects, or complements.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>That-clauses</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Introduced by <em>that</em> (which may be omitted in some positions):</p>

    <p><em>As subject</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>That she won surprised no one.</p></li>
      <li><p>That the earth is round is well established.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As object</em> (that often omitted):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I believe <em>(that)</em> she's honest."</p></li>
      <li><p>"He knows <em>(that)</em> we're coming."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As complement</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"The truth is <em>that we need more time</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"My hope is <em>that things will improve</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>After adjectives</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I'm glad <em>that you came</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"She was certain <em>that he was wrong</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Wh-clauses (Interrogative Content Clauses)</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Introduced by wh-words (what, who, which, where, when, why, how, whether, if):</p>

    <p><em>As subject</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What she discovered changed everything.</p></li>
      <li><p>Where they went remains a mystery.</p></li>
      <li><p>Whether he'll accept is uncertain.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As object</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I don't know <em>what happened</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"She asked <em>whether I was coming</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"Tell me <em>how you did it</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As complement</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"The issue is <em>how we proceed</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"The question is <em>whether to accept</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>If vs. Whether</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Both introduce yes/no noun clauses, but:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Whether</em> can be a subject; <em>if</em> typically cannot:</p></li>
      <li><p>Whether he comes remains to be seen. ✓</p></li>
      <li><p><em>~~<em>If</em> he comes remains to be seen.~~</em> ✗ (awkward)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>Whether</em> allows <em>or not</em> immediately after; <em>if</em> does not:</p></li>
      <li><p>"I don't know <em>whether or not</em> she's coming." ✓</p></li>
      <li><p><em>~~I don't know <em>if or not</em> she's coming.~~</em> ✗</p></li>

    <title>Gerund Phrases as Nominals</title>

    <p>A <em>gerund</em> is the <em>-ing</em> form of a verb functioning nominally. A <em>gerund phrase</em> includes the gerund and its complements/modifiers.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Gerund Structure</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>```</p>

    <p>Gerund Phrase = (Possessive) + Gerund + (Complements/Modifiers)</p>

    <p>```</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Swimming is fun. (simple gerund)</p></li>
      <li><p>Swimming laps is good exercise. (gerund + object)</p></li>
      <li><p>His swimming improved. (possessive + gerund)</p></li>
      <li><p>Their constantly complaining annoys everyone. (possessive + modifier + gerund)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Gerund Functions</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>As subject</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Running marathons requires dedication.</p></li>
      <li><p>Finishing on time seemed impossible.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As object</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"She enjoys <em>cooking elaborate meals</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"He avoided <em>making promises</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As object of preposition</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"She succeeded by <em>working hard</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"He's interested in <em>learning languages</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>As complement</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"His favorite activity is <em>reading</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"The challenge was <em>convincing the board</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Possessive with Gerunds</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Formal usage prefers possessive forms before gerunds:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I appreciated <em>his helping</em> us." (formal)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I appreciated <em>him helping</em> us." (informal)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both are acceptable in modern English, though the possessive is preferred in formal writing.</p>

    <title>Infinitive Phrases as Nominals</title>

      <title>Extraposition</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>When infinitive subjects are long, English often "extraposits" them, using <em>it</em> as a placeholder subject:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>To explain all the details would take too long. (full subject)</p></li>
      <li><p><em><em>It</em> would take too long <em>to explain all the details</em>.</em> (extraposed)</p></li>

    <title>Comparing Nominal Structures</title>

    <p>Different nominal structures may seem interchangeable but often carry subtle differences in meaning or style.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Gerund vs. Infinitive</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Many verbs take either gerund or infinitive objects with little difference:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I like <em>swimming</em>." / "I like <em>to swim</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"She started <em>working</em>." / "She started <em>to work</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>But some verbs show clear differences:</p>

    <p><em>Gerund only</em>: enjoy, avoid, finish, deny, consider</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"She enjoys <em>swimming</em>." (not ~~to swim~~)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Infinitive only</em>: want, hope, decide, agree, refuse</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"She wants <em>to swim</em>." (not ~~swimming~~)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Different meanings</em>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I stopped <em>smoking</em>." (quit the habit)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I stopped <em>to smoke</em>." (paused in order to smoke)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I remember <em>locking</em> the door." (I recall doing it)</p></li>
      <li><p>"I remember <em>to lock</em> the door." (I don't forget to do it)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>That-clause vs. Infinitive</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some verbs allow both:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"I believe <em>that she's honest</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"I believe <em>her to be honest</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The infinitive construction may sound more formal.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>That-clause vs. Gerund</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Some verbs take either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>"He admitted <em>that he was wrong</em>."</p></li>
      <li><p>"He admitted <em>being wrong</em>."</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The gerund is often more concise.</p>
