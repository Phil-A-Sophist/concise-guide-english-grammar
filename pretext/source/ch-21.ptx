    <title>Why Teach Grammar?</title>

    <p>Grammar instruction has been debated for centuries. Understanding the purposes of grammar teaching helps us teach it effectively.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Grammar for L1 Speakers</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Native speakers already have <em>implicit knowledge</em> of grammar—they know intuitively what's grammatical. L1 grammar instruction aims to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Develop metalinguistic awareness: Conscious knowledge about language structure</p></li>
      <li><p>Expand repertoire: Exposing students to structures they may not use</p></li>
      <li><p>Improve writing: Moving from speech patterns to written conventions</p></li>
      <li><p>Teach editing skills: Recognizing and revising errors</p></li>
      <li><p>Build analytical skills: Using grammar as a tool for analysis</p></li>
    </ol>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Grammar for L2 Learners</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>L2 learners are still developing their English. Grammar instruction aims to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Accelerate acquisition: Drawing attention to forms learners might not notice</p></li>
      <li><p>Increase accuracy: Helping learners produce correct structures</p></li>
      <li><p>Build explicit knowledge: Providing rules that can support performance</p></li>
      <li><p>Develop monitoring skills: Teaching learners to check their own output</p></li>
      <li><p>Raise awareness: Showing how English differs from the learner's L1</p></li>
    </ol>

    <title>L1 Grammar Instruction</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Context</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Native English speakers come to school already fluent. They don't need grammar instruction to communicate—they've been doing that for years. What they need is awareness of how language works and control over written conventions.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Effective Approaches for L1</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Connect to reading and writing</em>: Grammar instruction is most effective when tied to actual language use, not isolated drills.</p>

    <p><em>Use authentic texts</em>: Analyze real examples from literature, journalism, and student writing rather than invented sentences.</p>

    <p><em>Focus on choices</em>: Help students see grammar as a set of options for expressing ideas, not just rules to follow.</p>

    <p><em>Emphasize revision</em>: Grammar knowledge helps writers during revision—recognizing problems and fixing them.</p>

    <p><em>Build metalanguage gradually</em>: Students need terminology to talk about language, but terminology without understanding is useless.</p>

    <title>L2 Grammar Instruction</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Context</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>L2 learners are acquiring English as an additional language. Their first language influences how they perceive and produce English, creating predictable patterns of difficulty.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>The Role of Explicit Knowledge</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Research suggests that explicit grammar knowledge (conscious rules) can:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Help learners <em>notice</em> features they might otherwise miss</p></li>
      <li><p>Serve as a <em>monitor</em> for checking output</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Accelerate</em> certain aspects of acquisition</p></li>
      <li><p>Support <em>accuracy</em> in formal contexts</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, explicit knowledge alone doesn't guarantee fluent, accurate use. Learners also need <em>input</em>, <em>practice</em>, and <em>communicative opportunities</em>.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Focus on Form</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Focus on Form</em> (Long, 1991) refers to briefly drawing learners' attention to linguistic features during communicative activities. Unlike traditional grammar drilling, it integrates grammar into meaningful communication.</p>

    <p>Key principles:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Grammar instruction works best when it addresses forms learners are <em>ready</em> to acquire</p></li>
      <li><p>Attention to form should be <em>brief</em> and <em>meaningful</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Grammar should be taught in <em>context</em>, not in isolation</p></li>
      <li><p>Learners benefit from <em>noticing</em> forms in input</p></li>
    </ol>

    <title>Approaches to Teaching Grammar</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Deductive Teaching</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Deductive teaching</em> moves from rule to practice:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Present the rule explicitly</p></li>
      <li><p>Give examples</p></li>
      <li><p>Practice applying the rule</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Advantages</em>: Efficient, clear, suits analytical learners</p>

    <p><em>Disadvantages</em>: May not lead to automatic use; doesn't engage discovery</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Inductive Teaching</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Inductive teaching</em> moves from examples to rule:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><p>Present examples</p></li>
      <li><p>Guide learners to notice patterns</p></li>
      <li><p>Help learners formulate the rule</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Advantages</em>: Engages active learning, may lead to deeper understanding</p>

    <p><em>Disadvantages</em>: Time-consuming, may lead to incorrect generalizations</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>A Balanced Approach</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Effective teachers use both approaches depending on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>The <em>complexity</em> of the structure</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Learner preferences</em> and levels</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Time</em> available</p></li>
      <li><p>Whether learners need to <em>produce</em> or just <em>recognize</em> the form</p></li>
    </ul>

    <title>Common L2 Challenges by L1 Background</title>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Article Usage</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Languages without articles (Chinese, Japanese, Russian, etc.) pose challenges:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>~~She is teacher.~~</em> → <em>She is <em>a</em> teacher.</em></p></li>
      <li><p><em>~~I saw elephant.~~</em> → <em>I saw <em>an</em> elephant.</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Teaching tip</em>: Focus on the concept of countability and definiteness, not just rules.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Verb Tense and Aspect</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Languages with different tense/aspect systems create confusion:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Present perfect vs. simple past: <em>~~I have seen her yesterday.~~</em></p></li>
      <li><p>Progressive aspect: <em>~~I am knowing the answer.~~</em> (stative verbs)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Teaching tip</em>: Emphasize meaning distinctions, not just forms.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Word Order</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>L1 word order may transfer inappropriately:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Question formation: <em>~~You are coming?~~</em> (missing inversion)</p></li>
      <li><p>Adjective position: <em>~~the car red~~</em> (Romance languages)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Teaching tip</em>: Provide lots of input and practice with target patterns.</p>

    <paragraphs>
      <title>Prepositions</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p>Preposition usage rarely transfers directly:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>in</em> vs. <em>on</em> vs. <em>at</em> for location and time</p></li>
      <li><p>Verb + preposition combinations: <em>depend on</em>, <em>interested in</em></p></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Teaching tip</em>: Teach prepositions in chunks and collocations.</p>

    <title>Homework: Teaching Grammar</title>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Part A: Analyzing Your Own Grammar Learning</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 1.</em> Think back to your own experience learning grammar—whether in English class, learning a second language, or through informal instruction from family or teachers. Describe <em>two specific grammar lessons or corrections</em> you remember. For each:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What were you taught (or corrected on)?</p></li>
      <li><p>Was the instruction effective? Did it "stick"?</p></li>
      <li><p>Looking back, was this a prescriptive rule, a descriptive pattern, or something else?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Experience 1:</p>

    <p>Experience 2:</p>

    <p><em>Question 2.</em> The chapter distinguishes between <em>explicit knowledge</em> (conscious rules you can state) and <em>implicit knowledge</em> (unconscious patterns you use automatically). Think about your own language use:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Name one grammar pattern you can <em>state as a rule</em> and apply consciously.</p></li>
      <li><p>Name one grammar pattern you <em>use automatically</em> without being able to explain the rule.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>What does this tell you about the relationship between knowing a rule and using language correctly?</p>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Part B: L1 vs. L2 Instruction</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 3.</em> The chapter explains that L1 (native speaker) grammar instruction and L2 (language learner) grammar instruction have different goals. In your own words, explain <em>why these goals differ</em>. What does a native English speaker already know that a language learner doesn't? (1 paragraph)</p>

    <p><em>Question 4.</em> Consider the sentence: <em>"Me and him went to the store."</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>If a native English speaker produces this sentence, what kind of instruction might be appropriate?</p></li>
      <li><p>If an L2 learner produces this sentence, what different considerations would a teacher need to think about?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Explain the difference in 1–2 paragraphs.</p>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Part C: Error Analysis</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 5.</em> The following are common errors made by English language learners. For each one:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Identify the likely <em>cause</em> (e.g., L1 transfer, overgeneralization, incomplete acquisition)</p></li>
      <li><p>Suggest what a teacher might do to address it</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>a) <em>She goed to the store yesterday.</em></p>

    <p>Likely cause:</p>

    <p>Teaching approach:</p>

    <p>b) <em>I have seen him yesterday.</em></p>

    <p>Likely cause:</p>

    <p>Teaching approach:</p>

    <p>c) <em>She is teacher in my school.</em></p>

    <p>Likely cause:</p>

    <p>Teaching approach:</p>

    <p>d) <em>Where you are going?</em></p>

    <p>Likely cause:</p>

    <p>Teaching approach:</p>


    <paragraphs>
      <title>Part D: Reflection on Teaching and Learning</title>
    </paragraphs>

    <p><em>Question 6.</em> Think about a specific grammar concept that you once found confusing but now understand (this could be from English class, a foreign language class, or self-study). Describe:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What was the concept?</p></li>
      <li><p>What helped you finally understand it?</p></li>
      <li><p>What approaches <em>didn't</em> work for you?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Question 7.</em> The chapter discusses different approaches to error correction, from explicit correction ("No, say it this way") to indirect feedback (recasting, clarification requests). Think about corrections you've received on your own writing or speaking:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>What type of feedback has been most helpful to you?</p></li>
      <li><p>What type of feedback has felt discouraging or unhelpful?</p></li>
      <li><p>Based on your own experience, what principles would you follow if you were helping someone else improve their grammar?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Question 8.</em> (Optional—for students interested in teaching) If you were designing a grammar lesson for either native speakers or language learners, what principles from this chapter would guide your approach? What would you do differently from how you were taught? (1–2 paragraphs)</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p><em>L1 instruction</em> develops metalinguistic awareness and writing skills in native speakers.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>L2 instruction</em> supports acquisition and accuracy for learners of English as an additional language.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Explicit knowledge</em> can help learners notice forms and monitor output.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Deductive teaching</em> (rule → practice) is efficient; <em>inductive teaching</em> (examples → rule) engages discovery.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Error correction</em> should be strategic, considering context and learner needs.</p></li>
      <li><p>L2 challenges often reflect <em>L1 transfer</em>; teachers should anticipate common issues.</p></li>
      <li><p>Effective grammar activities are <em>meaningful</em>, <em>contextualized</em>, and <em>appropriately challenging</em>.</p></li>
